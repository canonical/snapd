# This systemd unit is needed on distributions that use apparmor but don't have
# special support for loading snapd apparmor profiles. Until upstream apparmor
# user-space release contains a systemd unit that is actually shipped by
# distributors and that contains the necessary extension points for snapd the
# apparmor profiles for snap applications need to be loaded separately from
# other applications.
