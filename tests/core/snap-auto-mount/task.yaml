summary: Check that `snap auto-import` works as expected

details: |
    The auto-import command searches available mounted devices looking for
    assertions that are signed by trusted authorities, and potentially
    performs system changes based on them.

    If one or more device paths are provided via --mount, these are temporarily
    mounted to be inspected as well

    Assertions to be imported must be made available in the auto-import.assert file
    in the root of the filesystem.

    This test creates new block device to trigger auto-import mount and then
    verifies the auto-mount magic has given us the assertion.
