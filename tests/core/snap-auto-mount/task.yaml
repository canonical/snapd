summary: Check that `snap auto-import` works as expected

details: |
    The auto-import command searches available mounted devices looking for
    assertions that are signed by trusted authorities, and potentially
    performs system changes based on them.

    If one or more device paths are provided via --mount, these are temporarily
    mounted to be inspected as well

    Assertions to be imported must be made available in the auto-import.assert file
    in the root of the filesystem.

    This test creates new block device to trigger auto-import mount and then
    verifies the auto-mount magic has given us the assertion.

# On core24 the udev rules will not trigger because the dm device 
# that is set up is not marked 'removable', the udev rules has been 
# changed in core24 to require this for auto-import - this test should be 
# rewritten to be a nested test and tested with a fake usb-device in 
# qemu instead of trying to fake it with a dm device.
