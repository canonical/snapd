summary: Check that the ubuntu-core system is rebooted after the core snap is refreshed

details: |
    This test checks that when invoking a manual refresh/revert for core or core18 snaps,
    a reboot is triggered and the command would exit after the first phase of the installation
    reporting "snapd is about to reboot the system" or "Change X waiting on external action to be completed"

systems: [ubuntu-core-*]

environment:
    # uploading the core or otherwise large snap triggers OOM
    SNAPD_NO_MEMORY_LIMIT: 1

prepare: |
    # make sure that the snapd daemon gives us time for comms before
    # closing the socket
