summary: Ensure we have unpacked kernel.img/initrd.img on uboot systems

details: |
    In Ubuntu Core systems the kernel is unpacked in different locations depending
    on the version.

    This test verifies that in Ubuntu Core 20+ the the kernel snap is extracted
    onto ubuntu-seed and in previous systems the kernel snap is extracted onto
    /boot/uboot.

systems: [ubuntu-core-*-arm-*]

environment:
    NAME/initrdimg: initrd.img
    NAME/kernelimg: kernel.img

execute: |
    if snap list pc; then
        echo "Neither kernel.img not initrd.img in images with pc gadget installed"
        exit
    fi

    if os.query is-core20 || os.query is-core22; then
        echo "Check that on UC20 and UC22, the kernel snap is extracted onto ubuntu-seed, not on ubuntu-boot"
        output=$(find /run/mnt/ubuntu-seed/systems/*/kernel/ -name "$NAME" )
        if [ -z "$output" ]; then
            echo "Not found expected file $NAME in /run/mnt/ubuntu-seed/systems/*/kernel/"
            exit 1
        fi
    else
        echo "Check that on non UC20, the kernel snap is extracted onto /boot/uboot"
        output=$(find /boot/uboot/*-kernel_*.snap/ -name "$NAME" )
        if [ -z "$output" ]; then
            echo "Not found expected file $NAME in /boot/uboot/*-kernel_*.snap/"
            exit 1
        fi
