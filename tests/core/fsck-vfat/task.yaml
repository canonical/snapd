summary: the boot base provides essential fsck programs

details: |
  Snapd uses vfat on certain essential boot partitions, due to external
  requirements imposed by the bootloader architecture. This test verifies
  that fsck.vfat is shipped in the image, and that it can correctly clean
  the dirty bit that is artificially set by this test.

  A separate test examines how fsck is automatically invoked during the boot
  process. This is not verified here.

  echo "Essential fsck programs are in the boot base"
  test -n "$(command -v fsck.vfat)"
  test -n "$(command -v fsck.fat)"

  echo "mkfs.vfat can create a FAT 12 filesystem"

  echo "We can simulate uncleanly unmounted FAT"
  # FAT uses a specific byte to effectively indicate that the file system is
  # dirty. The precise details as to how this byte is used by each system vary,
  # but Linux sets it on a non-read-only mount, and clears it on unmount. We
  # can set it manually, verify it when the image is mounted and observe fsck
  # clearing it. Note that larger block devices use FAT32 and the offset
  # differs. FAT12 and FAT16 uses 37 while FAT32 uses 65.
