summary: the boot base provides essential fsck programs

details: |
  Snapd uses vfat on certain essential boot partitions, due to external
  requirements imposed by the bootloader architecture. This test verifies that
  the boot process is capable of detecting unclean vfat and fixing it before
  such file system is mounted. This is an essential property to ensure
  longevity of devices that rely on write to vfat to operate.
