summary: Ensure that netplan config integration works

details: |
    Check the netplan configuration is correct in Ubuntu Core 20+. Verify
    that is is possible to add a br54 interface via netplan, including the
    configuration for dhcp4 and dhcp6. Verify the unset for the whole br54
    subtree works

# TODO: enable for all ubuntu core versions once netplan.io got SRUed
#       into the older versions of ubuntu
systems:
    - ubuntu-core-2*
  - ubuntu-core-20-*
  - ubuntu-core-22-*
