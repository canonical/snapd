summary: Check that the seed symlinks work

details: |
    This test checks that the snap is a symlink into the seed

# We explicitly don't want symlinks from /var/lib/snapd/snaps to
# /var/lib/snapd/seed in UC20 run mode because /var/lib/snapd/seed snaps are
# essentially untrusted
systems:
  - -ubuntu-core-2*

execute: |
    # shellcheck source=tests/lib/systems.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB/systems.sh"

    TARGET_SNAP=core
    if os.query is-core18; then
        TARGET_SNAP=core18
    fi

    echo "Ensure that the $TARGET_SNAP snap is a symlink into the seed"
    core_symlink="$(readlink -f /var/lib/snapd/snaps/${TARGET_SNAP}_*.snap)"
    if [[ "${core_symlink}" != /var/lib/snapd/seed/snaps/* ]]; then
        echo "The initial $TARGET_SNAP snap should symlink into the seed directory"
        echo "but it does not."
