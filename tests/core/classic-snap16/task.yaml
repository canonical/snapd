summary: Ensure classic dimension works correctly

details: |
    Validates classic snap can be installed in uc16. Check that classic can 
    run commands inside classic and sudo works without a password inside
    classic.

# classic snap is not maintained for UC18+, for these releases the lxd snaps is
# recommended instead of the classic snap
systems: [ubuntu-core-16-*]

environment:
    # We need to set the SUDO_USER here to simulate the real
    # behavior. I.e. when entering classic it happens via
    # `sudo classic` and the user gets a user shell inside
    # the classic environment that has sudo support.
    SUDO_USER: test

prepare: |
    echo "test ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/create-test

restore: |
    rm -f /etc/sudoers.d/create-test
    # Undo the change done by the classic snap.
    # FIXME: https://github.com/snapcore/classic-snap/issues/32
