summary: Ensure snap userd returns an error for xdg-open requests on Core

details: |
    Snapd contains a system where XDG utility programs, that applications may
    commonly call, are replaced with programs that communicate the request back
    to snapd user session daemon, to present a question to the user.

    The test verifies that the 'xdg-open' program is not supported in Ubuntu Core
    systems

    - reason: The system has not systemd or dbus session
      if: not tests.session has-session-systemd-and-dbus
