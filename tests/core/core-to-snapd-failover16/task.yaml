summary: Test the failover scenario of the snapd snap installation on a UC16 system

details: |
  Checks the failover scenario of the snapd snap installation by installing it
  multiple times to ensure that we can revert back to the core snap as many times
  as needed. Verify that snapd.failure was activated when we tried to install
  a broken snapd.

# snapd snap is already installed by default on uc18+
systems: [ubuntu-core-16-*]
