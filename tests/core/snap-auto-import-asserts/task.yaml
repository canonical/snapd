summary: Check that `snap auto-import` works as expected

details: |
    The auto-import command searches available mounted devices looking for
    assertions that are signed by trusted authorities, and potentially
    performs system changes based on them.

    Assertions to be imported must be made available in the auto-import.assert file
    in the root of the filesystem.

    Having created a ramdisk with the account-key assertion, this test verifies that
    an account key can be imported by the `snap auto-import` command from the
    mounted ramdisk.
