summary: Test journal.persistent core config option is honored by journal namespaces

details: |
  In Ubuntu Core systems journal.persistent core config option can be used to
  enable and disable the journal persistence. If persistent journals were previously
  enabled by this setting, changing the value to false will delete all saved logs.

  This test verifies that when journal.persistent core config is set to true, the
  journal logs are written and those are deleted when the config is set to false.
  Also it is verified that a journal quota group can be created, and the presence
  of its corresponding namespace log.

# these systems do not support journal quota groups due to their old systemd versions.
# requires systemd v245+

  - -ubuntu-core-16-*
