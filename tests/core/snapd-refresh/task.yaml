summary: Test refreshing snapd and running new units

details: |
    Check that snapd can be installed and reverted many times in a row resulting in a
    working snapd. Also ensure snapd is working after a reboot.

# UC16 still uses the core snap rather than the snapd snap, so disable this test
# for UC16
