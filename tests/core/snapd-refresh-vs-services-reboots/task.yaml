  # We need special restore code here for the snapd snap because of the multiple
  # variants of this test and existing subtle bugs in our restore code. The issue
  # is that when we install a new revision of the snapd snap dangerously without
  # store assertions, at the
  # end of the test to ensure that other tests use the snapd version that we
  # started with, we revert the snapd snap to the original revision without 
  # triggering a garbage collection of the revisions we reverted away from (i.e.
  # the new revisions we installed as part of this test execution). This is 
  # problematic because it leaves those old revisions mounted at /snap/snapd/x2
  # for example and now at the end of the test the active revision of snapd is 
  # x1. Then during the next test execution that tries to install a dangerous 
  # local revision of snapd, it will have lost any reference to the previous x2
  # revision (since we clear state.json at the end of the test execution in 
  # reset.sh), and now snapd is trying to install and make active x2 again, and
  # it will copy all the right files, but when it comes time to mount the new x2
  # revision of snapd, there will already be an existing active mount unit for 
  # the previous revision at /snap/snapd/x2, and so the bits of code that try
  # to mount the .snap file there will effectively just silently fail since the
  # is already a snapd snap mounted there, it is just the wrong one mounted 
  # there. 

  # We remedy this here, temporarily, by first manually executing all cleanups
  # that were deferred, since one of those deferred cleanups is likely the 
  # revert to the previous revision of the snapd snap, and then we manually 
  # remove all disabled revisions of the snapd snap - this manual removal will
  # in fact unmount the mount units for /snap/snapd/x2 for example, avoiding the
  # bug.
