summary: Ensure that netplan works on Ubuntu Core with network-setup-{control,observe}

details: |
    Netplan apply is used to apply network configuration to the system

environment:
    NETPLAN: io.netplan.Netplan

# TODO:UC20: enable, fails right now with: "The permission of the
#            setuid helper is not correct", the issue is with the permissions of
#            /usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper - it shows up as not
#            being in the right group because the /etc/group from the classic
#            host that we use to prepare the core system has a different group
#            defined for gid 103 (which on core is messagebus, but on classic is
#            systemd-network), and thus the dbus daemon thinks it has the wrong
#            permissions (well basically speaking it does)
