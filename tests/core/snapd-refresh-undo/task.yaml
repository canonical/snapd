summary: Verify that snapd can undo the upgrade from non-snapd-snap to snapd-snap

details: |
  Verify that the snapd-snap can successfully undo after upgrading from a non snapd-snap
  situation, and something causes a rollback even in spite of a successful snapd update.

# UC16 still uses the core snap rather than the snapd snap, so disable this test
# for UC16
