summary: Check that refreshing snapd does not interfere with snap services

details: |
  This test verifies the fix for the issue raised in https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1924805
  which fixes a race condition on certain devices where the device unexpectedly reboots during a
  snapd refresh.

  The problem is reproduced when we refresh snapd itself after having written out some systemd
  units that include the Requires= above (which could happen for app snap refreshes or new
  installs after snapd 2.49.2 is installed), then unmount/stop usr-lib-snapd.mount which,
  due to how Requires= works, will forcibly stop all services which have the Requires= bit in it.
  Then, after snapd finishes refreshing itself, those services will be left in the
  terminated state, effectively killing the services when snapd refreshes itself.
