summary: Check that snapd failure handling works

details: |
    Snapd has a failure handling mechanism to auto revert when a refresh process fails. 
    This test verifies this mechanism by trying to install a broken snapd snap
    multiple times to validate that if a device wants to keep trying a refresh to a
    broken snapd snap for some reason, it will be able to revert and fallback
    as many times as needed. Also checks that after the revert, the snapd snap
    revision has to be the same as before the broken one was installed.

prepare: |
    # on UC16, we should transition to using the snapd snap before running the 
    # test because it by default uses the core snap
    # there is a different test for the transition between the core snap and the
    # snapd snap

        # rebuild the core snap into the snapd snap and install it
