summary: Ensure that we can create swapfiles

prepare: |
  cp /etc/default/swapfile swapfile.bk

restore: |
  if [ -f swapfile.bk ]; then 
    cp swapfile.bk /etc/default/swapfile

    # enabling the service now again will set swap to 0 because SIZE=0 means 
    # don't create a swap file
    systemctl enable --now swapfile.service || true
  fi

execute: |
  echo "Set swapfile to 200"
  # don't use sed -i because /etc/default is not writable and this will fail
  sed -e "s/SIZE=0/SIZE=200/" /etc/default/swapfile > /tmp/swapfile
  cat /tmp/swapfile > /etc/default/swapfile

  echo "Turn on the swap service"

  # source the file so that we can grep for the location of the swap file as
  # configured
  # shellcheck disable=SC1091
