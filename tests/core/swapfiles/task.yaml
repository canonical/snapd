execute: |
  echo "Set swap size to 200M"
  snap set system swap.size=200M

  echo "Check that the swap file was setup"
  # use swapon as it rounds up the numbers nicely
  retry -n 60 --wait 1 bash -c "swapon --show | MATCH '\s+file\s+200M\s'"

  echo "Unset the swap size"
  snap unset system swap.size

  echo "Check that there is no more swap now"
  retry -n 60 --wait 1 bash -c "cat /proc/swaps | NOMATCH '\s+file\s+'"
