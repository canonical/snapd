summary: Build the test suite for C code using clang and run it

details: |
    Parts of snapd are implemented in C. Historically the default C compiler is
    from the GNU Compiler Collection project. Over time the LLVM/Clang project
    has matured and is now a high-performance, viable compiler that offers
    additional diagnostic messages not found in GCC. We want to make sure that
    snapd can be built with CC=clang, and that all the C-based unit tests pass.

prepare: |
