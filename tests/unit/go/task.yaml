summary: Run project static and unit tests

details: |
    Most of snapd is implemented in Go. Some Go programs use elements of C that
    are sensitive to the specific C compiler used. We want to make sure that Go
    unit tests pass when executed as a non-root user. The test has three
    variants: one that uses GCC as the C compiler, one that uses Clang and one
    that only runs static analysis checks. That last variant is particularly
    used by ancient versions of Ubuntu, such as Ubuntu 14.04, which is too old
    to provide an adequate toolchain and lacks systemd running as session
    manager, which is needed by the session test tool.

# Start before anything else as it takes a long time.
priority: 1000

# tests.session requires busctl, which is not available on 14.04, but we still
# want to run the tests there at the same time, we should not run into problems
# with delayed session cleanup on this system

    VARIANT/clang: clang
    VARIANT/gcc: gcc
