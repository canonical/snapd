summary: "regression test for LP: #1813963"

details: |
    During startup of snap application processes, the snap-confine helper forks
    to perform exploratory actions without clobbering important state in the
    main processes. The two processes communicate, among other, with a pipe. A
    specific version of snapd contained a flaw, where one of the forked
    processes could be killed with SIGPIPE instead of handling EPIPE errno
    value. The code was adjusted to handle this correctly and this integration
    test was crafted to ensure a timeout is hit, and that one of the helper
    processes dies in a specific way, then snap-confine itself handles this
    possibility correctly.
