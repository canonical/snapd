summary: regression test for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snappy/+bug/1812973

details: |
    Snapd has built-in deny-list that prevents any application from using a
    specific ioctl from injecting keystrokes into the tty, which could be used
    by a confined snap to tell the terminal to execute arbitrary commands.

    The test snap attempts to execute that ioctl, and observe that it is
    blocked. The test has two variants, for low and high bits present in the
    ioctl, to ensure that the deny list is accurate.

# Skip core as we don't have a compiler there.
# Skip -32 bit arches as the blacklist is not useful there.
systems: [-ubuntu-core-*, -*-32]
