summary: apparmor backend is not used on openSUSE Leap 42.3

details: |
    AppArmor on openSUSE Leap 43.2 is too old to parse the snap-confine
    apparmor profile.  Because of "relaxed" error handling snapd was enabling
    apparmor backend even though it resulted in constant problems with setting
    up security for the core snap. With this bug fixed the old version of
    apparmor_parser makes snapd disable the relevant security backend.
