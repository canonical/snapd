summary: apparmor backend is used when apparmor tooling is compatible

details: |
    AppArmor on openSUSE Leap 43.2 is too old to parse the snap-confine apparmor
    profile. Because of "relaxed" error handling snapd was enabling apparmor
    backend even though it resulted in constant problems with setting up
    security for the core snap. With this bug fixed the old version of
    apparmor_parser makes snapd disable the relevant security backend.
    Make sure that apparmor backend is not disabled on systems where apparmor
    tooling is recent enough.
