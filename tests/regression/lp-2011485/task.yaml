summary: docker-support should have access to /etc/apparmor.d/abi/

details: |
    The docker-support interface allows snap applications to interact with
    apparmor. Over time, apparmor introduced the ABI concept and created the new
    directory where sets of ABIs can be referenced, pinning behavior of a
    profile to what is supported by that specific ABI, preventing "floating"
    behavior that changes from one kernel version to another, where future
    kernel can reject something that was allowed by a past kernel.

    To access this functionality, the snap application process must have access
    to read files from the /etc/apparmor.d/abi directory. The test constructs an
    environment where this property can be tested and ensures that files are
    indeed readable.

# This test case is only interesting on modern classic systems with
# apparmor in enforcing mode by default
systems: [ubuntu-2*]

    # Real snaps in real environment must cope with lack of apparmor anyway.
