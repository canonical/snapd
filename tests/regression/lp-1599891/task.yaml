summary: Regression check for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snap-confine/+bug/1599891

details: |
    During the transition to snap-confine as a part of snapd, we had issues with
    the apparmor profile for the snap-confine program installed in
    /usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine which was related to how Debian handles
    configuration files. This test ensures that at the end of the day,
    snap-confine was still executed with an enforced profile.

# No confinement (AppArmor, Seccomp) available on these systems
systems: [-debian-*, -fedora-*, -opensuse-*, -arch-*, -amazon-*, -centos-*]

execute: |
    snap_confine=/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine
    echo "Seeing that snap-confine is in $snap_confine"

    echo "I also see a corresponding apparmor profile"
    MATCH "$snap_confine \\(enforce\\)" < /sys/kernel/security/apparmor/profiles
