summary: Verify directories from the base snap are not mounted over symlinks in /etc

description: |
  The host's /etc is made avaialable inside the snap's mount namespace. During
  setup, snap-confine attempts to preserve some entries from the base snap to
  present a uniform environment for the snaps. When the entries in host
  namespace are symlinks, they are followed when mounting and the mount, with
  source from the base snap, appears in the host's mount namespace.

# we only know of this happening on Fedora, see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1584461

    if [ "$(readlink /etc/ssl)" == "/etc/ssl-backup" ]; then
