summary: regression test for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1803535

details: |
    Snapd attempts to satisfy layout declarations by poking writable holes over
    read-only substrate, such as squashfs snap file systems, by using the
    so-called writable mimic, which is a in-memory temporary file system mounted
    over the same location, with place-holder files and directories that are
    used as bind-mount targets that re-create the original location. This
    writable mimic then allows snap-update-ns to create additional files or
    directories at will.

    Historically snap-update-ns would not clean one of the paths that was used
    during this transformation, leading to a difference over the trailing slash,
    which caused issue due to a needless re-construction of the writable mimic.

    This test captures the conditions of the problem, ensuring that we don't
    re-introduce it by accident.
