summary: Ensure that AppArmor paths are safe

details: |
    Some interfaces allow the developer to specify filesystem paths in their
    plug sttributes, which then get encoded into the AppArmor profile of the
    applications. We need to make sure that these paths are properly quoted,
    and that snapd will refuse to connect a plug whose paths include some
    invalid characters.
