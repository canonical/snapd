summary: Ensure that the systemctl from PR#8803 is fixed

details: |
    Snapd is sensitive to a bug in specific versions of systemd. This test
    attempts to trigger a race between systemctl daemon-reload and other
    systemctl commands by restarting systemd and starting the ssh service
    concurrently many times over.

    The original bug is reported as https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1819728

# TODO: enable on ubuntu-16.04-64, ubuntu-18.04-64 once the SRU
#       for systemd is in the "-updates" pocket.
systems:
    - ubuntu-core-16-64
    - ubuntu-core-18-64
    - ubuntu-core-20-64
    - ubuntu-core-22-64
