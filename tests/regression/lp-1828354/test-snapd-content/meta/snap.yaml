    # This is an old-style, non-aggregating content slot. The "content"
    # directory is directly mounted over the connected plug's target path. Had
    # we used the "source:" section to hold the "read:" entry we would get the
    # new, spool-like content slot where "content" is a sub-directory of the
    # directory designated by the connected plug's target path.
