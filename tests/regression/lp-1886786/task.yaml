summary: regression test for LP:#1886786

details: |
  Snapd has special logic that is only active during unit-testing. This is
  detected by looking for the .test suffix of the running executable. At one
  point in time this logic was buggy, causing any snap application with the word
  "test" in it, to misbehave and crash.

prepare: |
  "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-app-with-test-name

execute: |
  echo "running the command with .test suffix does not panic"
  test-snapd-app-with-test-name.test
