    # The path /usr/share/java/stub does not exist on core16, forcing a mimic
    # to be constructed at /usr/share/java. That directory is non-empty, having
    # one jar file, thus showing how mimic construction actually works. The
    # original bug used /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf but /usr/share is full of
    # stuff, making the effect of the bug harder to spot.
