summary: refreshing a snap with particular layout over itself
details: |
    This bug was hiding two separate bugs in snap-update-ns. The first
    one is that Keep changes were not tracked in filesystem
    assumptions, therefore did not participate in trespassing
    detection correctly. A mount namespace that chose to reuse a tmpfs
    (a keep mount change) would subsequently trigger a trespassing
    violation for a path that was directly under the mounted tmpfs.
    The second bug was that path creation code, which used a helper to
    create prefix, passed a directory name of the prefix with the
    trailing slash, which would not match the restrictive trespassing
    detection code.
