summary: ensure that /var/lib/snapd/hostfs is group-owned by root
details: |
    On a system that never ran any snap before the /var/lib/snapd/hostfs
    directory does not exist. When snap-confine is used it will create the
    directory on demand but that directory will retain the group identity of
    the user.

    if [ -d /var/lib/snapd/hostfs ]; then rmdir /var/lib/snapd/hostfs; fi
