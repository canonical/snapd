summary: ensure that /var/lib/snapd/hostfs is group-owned by root

details: |
    The directory /var/lib/snapd/hostfs was added after the initial release of
    snapd in 2016. When packaging system did not create the directory, the
    snap-confine program would automatically create it but due to an earlier
    mistake, the directory would retain the group ownership of the user which
    invoked snap-confine for the first time when that directory was missing.
    Snap-confine was later patched to avoid this problem, so that the directory
    was always group-owned by root.
