summary: ensure that /var/lib/snapd/hostfs is group-owned by root

details: |
    On a system that never ran any snap before the /var/lib/snapd/hostfs
    directory does not exist. When snap-confine is used it will create the
    directory on demand but that directory will retain the group identity of
    the user.

prepare: |
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-sh
    if [ -d /var/lib/snapd/hostfs ]; then
        rmdir /var/lib/snapd/hostfs;
    fi

execute: |
    test-snapd-sh.sh -c 'true'
    [ "$(stat -c '%g' /var/lib/snapd/hostfs)" -eq 0 ]
