summary: Check that snap try can be used for snaps in /tmp

details: |
    When snapd installs a snap from a local directory, the actual file is
    streamed from the snap client to snapd, and snapd writes the file to a
    temporary location in /tmp. We want to make sure that still stays true
    even if the snap itself is in /tmp.

prepare: |
    cp -a "$TESTSLIB"/snaps/test-snapd-sh /tmp

restore: |
    rm -rf /tmp/test-snapd-sh

execute: |
    ( cd /tmp && snap try test-snapd-sh )
    test-snapd-sh.sh -c /bin/true
