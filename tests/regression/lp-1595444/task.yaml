summary: Regression check for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snap-confine/+bug/1595444
details: |
    This task checks the behavior of snap-confine when it is started from
    a directory that doesn't exist in the execution environment (chroot).
# This test only applies to classic systems
systems: [-ubuntu-core-16-64, -ubuntu-core-16-arm-32, -ubuntu-core-16-arm-64]
prepare: |
    echo "Having installed the test snap"
    . $TESTSLIB/snaps.sh
    install_local test-snapd-tools
    echo "Hanving created a directory not present in the core snap"
    mkdir -p "/foo"
execute: |
    echo "We can go to a location that is available in all snaps (/tmp)"
    echo "We can run the 'pwd' tool and it reports /tmp"
    [ "$(cd /tmp && test-snapd-tools.cmd pwd)" = "/tmp" ]
    echo "But if we go to a location that is not available to snaps (e.g. /foo)"
    echo "Then snap-confine moves us to /var/lib/snapd/void"
    [ "$(cd /foo && test-snapd-tools.cmd pwd)" = "/var/lib/snapd/void" ]
    echo "And that directory is not readable or writable"
    [ "$(cd /foo && test-snapd-tools.cmd ls 2>&1)" = "ls: cannot open directory '.': Permission denied" ];
restore: |
    rm -f -d /foo
    # NOTE: the snap is blocked by apparmor from reading /var/lib/snapd/void
    dmesg -c
