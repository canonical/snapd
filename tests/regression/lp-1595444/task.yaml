summary: Regression check for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snap-confine/+bug/1595444

details: |
    This task checks the behavior of snap-confine when it is started from
    a directory that doesn't exist in the execution environment (chroot).

# This test only applies to classic systems
# Just available for systems with confinement (AppArmor, Seccomp)
systems: [-ubuntu-core-*, -debian-*, -fedora-*, -opensuse-*, -arch-*, -amazon-*]

prepare: |
    echo "Having installed the test snap"
    . "$TESTSLIB/snaps.sh"
    install_local test-snapd-tools
    echo "Hanving created a directory not present in the core snap"
    mkdir -p "/foo"

restore: |
    rm -f -d /foo
    # NOTE: the snap is blocked by apparmor from reading /var/lib/snapd/void
    dmesg -c

execute: |
    echo "We can go to a location that is available in all snaps (/tmp)"
    echo "We can run the 'pwd' tool and it reports /tmp"
    [ "$(cd /tmp && test-snapd-tools.cmd pwd)" = "/tmp" ]
    echo "But if we go to a location that is not available to snaps (e.g. /foo)"
    echo "Then snap-confine moves us to /var/lib/snapd/void"
    [ "$(cd /foo && test-snapd-tools.cmd pwd)" = "/var/lib/snapd/void" ]
    echo "And that directory is not readable or writable"
    [ "$(cd /foo && test-snapd-tools.cmd ls 2>&1)" = "ls: cannot open directory '.': Permission denied" ];
