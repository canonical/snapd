summary: Regression check for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snap-confine/+bug/1595444

details: |
    The snap execution environment uses a mount namespace that is somewhat
    different from that of the host, and it is possible to start a snap
    application from a directory that does not exists on the host but does not
    exist inside the execution environment (at least, not with the same path).
    When this happens, the start-up code changes the directory to
    /var/lib/snapd/void which is not readable or writable by anyone, with the
    hope to provide the "permission denied" error instead of something more
    confusing or technical in nature.

#ubuntu-core: this test only applies to classic systems
#debian, fedora, opensuse, arch, amazon-linux-2, centos: just available for systems with confinement (AppArmor, Seccomp)
systems: [-ubuntu-core-*, -debian-*, -fedora-*, -opensuse-*, -arch-*, -amazon-*, -centos-*]

prepare: |
    echo "Having installed the test snap"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-sh
    echo "Hanving created a directory not present in the core snap"
    mkdir -p "/foo"

restore: |
    rm -f -d /foo
    # NOTE: the snap is blocked by apparmor from reading /var/lib/snapd/void
    dmesg -c

execute: |
    echo "We can go to a location that is available in all snaps (/tmp)"
    echo "We can run the 'pwd' tool and it reports /tmp"
    [ "$(cd /tmp && test-snapd-sh.sh -c 'pwd')" = "/tmp" ]
    echo "But if we go to a location that is not available to snaps (e.g. /foo)"
    echo "Then snap-confine moves us to /var/lib/snapd/void"
    [ "$(cd /foo && test-snapd-sh.sh -c 'pwd')" = "/var/lib/snapd/void" ]
    echo "And that directory is not readable or writable"
    [ "$(cd /foo && test-snapd-sh.sh -c 'ls' 2>&1)" = "ls: cannot open directory '.': Permission denied" ];
