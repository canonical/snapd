summary: regression test for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1815722

details: |
    Snapd runs certain hooks during the installation of a package. If a certain
    hook fails, snapd will abort the installation of the package and undo all
    the tasks that had been executed. As a part of that process, it is important
    that the preserved mount namespace that is created for the hook is
    discarded, as it otherwise may prevent subsequent installation of a snap
    with the same name to fail.

    The test installs an specially crafted snap and ensures that the mount
    namespace is not left behind.
