summary: Broken snap doesn't break "snap list" and other operations
details: |
    Snap can enter the "broken" state when its meta/snap.yaml cannot be found.
    Typically this means the snap is unmounted or that "snap try"-mode snap was
    moved on disk and the symlink in /var/lib/snapd/snaps/ is no longer
    working.

    Broken snaps should not affect snapd operations though, as that forms a
    denial-of-service attack and may keep machines from refreshing core.
execute: |
    cp -a  $TESTSLIB/snaps/test-snapd-sh .
    snap try test-snapd-sh

    snap list | MATCH test-snapd-sh
    mv test-snapd-sh test-snapd-sh.moved
    snap list # should not break
    snap list test-snapd-sh | MATCH broken

    mv test-snapd-sh.moved test-snapd-sh
    snap list # should still just work
    snap list test-snapd-sh | MATCH -v broken
