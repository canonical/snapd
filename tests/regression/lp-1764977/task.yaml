summary: Broken snap doesn't break "snap list" and other operations

details: |
    Snap can enter the "broken" state when its meta/snap.yaml cannot be found.
    Typically this means the snap is unmounted or that "snap try"-mode snap was
    moved on disk and the symlink in /var/lib/snapd/snaps/ is no longer
    working.

    Broken snaps should not affect snapd operations though, as that forms a
    denial-of-service attack and may keep machines from refreshing core.

    Note that this test is subtly different from
    tests/main/try-snap-goes-away. In our case the meta/snap.yaml file is
    still present and can be read. In the other case it is removed when the
    snap is removed (individual files are unlinked and disappear from the
    bind-mounted view of the mounted snap).

execute: |
    cp -a  "$TESTSLIB"/snaps/test-snapd-sh .
    snap try test-snapd-sh

    snap list | MATCH test-snapd-sh
    mv test-snapd-sh/meta/snap.yaml test-snapd-sh/meta/snap.yaml.moved
    snap list # should not break
    snap list test-snapd-sh | MATCH broken

    mv test-snapd-sh/meta/snap.yaml.moved test-snapd-sh/meta/snap.yaml
    snap list # should still just work
    snap list test-snapd-sh | NOMATCH broken
