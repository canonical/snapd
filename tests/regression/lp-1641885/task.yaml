summary: snaps installed with --jailmode are not in devmode

details: |
    Users found that a snap that uses "confinement: devmode", even when
    installed with "snap install --jailmode" is effectively in devmode (the
    apparmor profile is in complain mode) even if "snap list" reports it as
    "jailmode".
    This has been reported as https://bugs.launchpad.net/snappy/+bug/1641885
