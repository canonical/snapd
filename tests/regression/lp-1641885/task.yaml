summary: snaps installed with --jailmode are not in devmode

# No confinement (AppArmor, Seccomp) available on these systems
systems: [-debian-*, -fedora-*, -opensuse-*, -arch-*, -amazon-*]

details: |
    Users found that a snap that uses "confinement: devmode", even when
    installed with "snap install --jailmode" is effectively in devmode (the
    apparmor profile is in complain mode) even if "snap list" reports it as
    "jailmode".
