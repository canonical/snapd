summary: Regression test for LP 1802581

details: |
    When using the snapd GPIO interface the slot side needs to export the GPIO
    pint so that a file appears under /sys/class/gpio/gpioNNN. That file is a
    symbolic link to a special, platform specific device path. The symbolic
    link needs to be evaluated so that apparmor rules for the plug side can be
    constructed.

    A customer has reported that when a snap is disabled and then re-enabled
    the GPIO pin is not exported and apparmor backend cannot setup security
    of the snap being enabled.

    A similar issue has occurred once in the past where the order in which
    security backends operated was not deterministic. We fixed the issue by
    applying a fixed order so that the systemd backend, responsible for
    exporting the pin, would always run before the apparmor backend, which
    could now rely on the pin being exposed to userspace.
