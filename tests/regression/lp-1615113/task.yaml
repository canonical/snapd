summary: Check that entire snap can be shared with the content interface

details: |
    During construction of the snap execution environment, the snap-confine
    program runs under apparmor confinement and needs to have permission to
    mount the /snap/$SNAP_NAME/$SNAP_REVISION directory from one snap to
    another. If snap-confine lacks permission to mount that directory, as
    opposed to mounting a sub-directory, then content sharing between two snaps
    may be broken.

prepare: |
    echo "Having installed a pair of snaps that share content"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-content-slot
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-content-plug
    echo "We can connect them together"
    snap connect test-snapd-content-plug:shared-content-plug test-snapd-content-slot:shared-content-slot

execute: |
    echo "We can now see that the content is shared"
    test-snapd-content-plug.content-plug | grep "Some shared content"
    echo "And fstab files are created"
    [ "$(find /var/lib/snapd/mount -type f -name '*.fstab' | wc -l)" -gt 0 ]
