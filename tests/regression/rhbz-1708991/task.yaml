summary: Check that snapd SELinux policy does not break systemd services with private mount ns

details: |
    Over time, systemd has introduced gradual confinement to many essential
    system services. Snapd has a separate SELinux policy module which interacts
    with the rest of the SELinux policy in non-trivial ways. One particular case
    was the ability to re-mount /var/lib/snapd/snap into a new mount namespace
    created by systemd.

    Ensure that snapd policy does not break systemd-resolved and
    systemd-hostnamed by switching on SELinux enforcement and restarting the two
    systemd services.

systems: [fedora-*, centos-*]

prepare: |
    getenforce > enforcing.mode

    # Enable enforcing mode, our policy is already marked as permissive, so we
    # will get audit entries but the program will not be stopped by SELinux
    setenforce 1
    ausearch --checkpoint stamp -m AVC || true

restore: |
    setenforce "$(cat enforcing.mode)"

execute: |
    # global prepare calls systemctl daemon-reexec to make systemd run with
    # additional init_t permissions from snapd package, workaround for:

    # No systemd-resolved and systemd-hostnamed services in centos 9
    if os.query is-centos 9; then
        exit
    fi

    # resolved and hostnamed have private mount ns
    systemctl restart systemd-resolved
    systemctl restart systemd-hostnamed
    ausearch -i --checkpoint stamp --start checkpoint -m AVC 2>&1 | MATCH 'no matches'
