summary: Regression check for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snap-confine/+bug/1606277

details: |
    During construction of the snap execution environment, the snap-confine
    program runs under apparmor confinement and needs to have permission to
    mount the /var/log directory from the host system into the snap execution
    environment being constructed. If snap-confine lacks permission to mount
    that directory a snap carrying a connected plug of the log-observe interface
    would not be able to see any files in the /var/log directory as seen from
    the perspective of the running snap application.

prepare: |
    echo "Having installed a test snap"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local log-observe-consumer
    echo "And having connected the log-observe interface"
    snap connect log-observe-consumer:log-observe :log-observe

execute: |
    echo "We can now see a non-empty /var/log directory"
    [ "$(log-observe-consumer.cmd ls /var/log | wc -l)" != 0 ]
