# TODO:UC20: no logs on a fresh uc20 system, discuss with foundations if
#            that is expected
systems: [-ubuntu-core-20-*]

details: |
    A missing bind mount for /var/log prevents access to system log files
    even if the log-observe interface is being used.

prepare: |
    #shellcheck source=tests/lib/snaps.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB/snaps.sh"
    echo "Having installed a test snap"
    install_local log-observe-consumer
    echo "And having connected the log-observe interface"
    snap connect log-observe-consumer:log-observe :log-observe

execute: |
    echo "We can now see a non-empty /var/log directory"
    [ "$(log-observe-consumer.cmd ls /var/log | wc -l)" != 0 ]
