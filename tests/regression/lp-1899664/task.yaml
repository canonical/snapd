summary: Test that read-only filesystem on /etc/dbus-1/session.d doesn't prevent snapd refresh.

details: |
  One of the snapd security backends is responsible for managing dbus rules for
  installed snap applications. Such rules are stored, among others, in the
  /etc/dbus-1/session.d directory.

  On core systems that directory may be read-only. Snapd should not fail to
  refresh itself if that condition is true. In essence this test checks that
  snapd can refresh even if the base snap without special provisions to make
  /etc/dbus-1/session.d writable has been installed yet.

systems: [ubuntu-core-18-64]

prepare: |
  mount -t tmpfs tmptfs -o ro /etc/dbus-1/session.d

restore: |
  umount /etc/dbus-1/session.d

execute: |
  # we are running current snapd build, re-install it to trigger core18
  # wrappers to be recreated.
