summary: Regression check for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snap-wrap/+bug/1580018
details: |
    On classic systems, the /etc/alternatives directory, if one exists, should
    be coming from the core snap (or the ubuntu-core snap). This allows snaps
    to rely on deterministic behavior, isolated from any changes imposed by
    Debian's alternatives system.
# This test only applies to classic systems
systems: [-ubuntu-core-16-*]
