summary: Ensure that nested layouts can be unmounted
details: |
    When a snap providing a nested layout is refreshed, as a part of the
    refresh the old mount points, corresponding to the revision being removed,
    cannot be unmounted without first unmounting all the children. To avoid
    this complex problem we use detach instead of unmount.
prepare: |
    snap pack test-snapd-layout
restore: |
    snap remove test-snapd-layout
    rm -f test-snapd-layout_1_all.snap
execute: |
    # Install x1 and run the app to construct the mount namespace
    snap install --dangerous test-snapd-layout_1_all.snap
    test-snapd-layout.sh -c /bin/true
    # Install x2 and ensure that the mount namespace allows /bin/true to execute
    snap install --dangerous test-snapd-layout_1_all.snap
    test-snapd-layout.sh -c /bin/true
