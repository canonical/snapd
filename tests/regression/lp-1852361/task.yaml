summary: regression test for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1852361

details: |
    Snapd attempts to update preserved mount namespaces when the per-snap mount
    profile is changed by interface connection changes, snap refreshes or even
    base snap refreshes. The exact way in which this is done is very complex and
    over time, a simpler method was devised, where bulk of the changes are
    undone and the namespace is re-constructed with the minimal attempt to
    reuse.

    This test constructs a mount namespace with features that captures the
    essence of a failure encountered in the field by a real snap application
    package, in order to show that the failure no longer occurs.

    Historically this test also enabled the robust-mount-namespace-updates feature,
    but it is now enabled by default.

    This test is related to lp-1844496, lp-1852361 and lp-1867193.
