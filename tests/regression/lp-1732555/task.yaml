summary: installing a snap with unknown plugs and slots is harmless

details: |
    Users have painfully found that a version of snapd crashed when a snap
    contained unknown interfaces in either plugs or slots.

prepare: |
    . "$TESTSLIB/snaps.sh"
    install_local_devmode test-snapd-unknown-interfaces

execute: |
    echo "Snapd did not die on us"
    snap version
    echo "The snap was installed and can be used"
    test-snapd-unknown-interfaces -c true
    echo "The bogus plugs and slots are not added"
    snap interfaces | MATCH -v bogus-plug
    snap interfaces | MATCH -v bogus-slot
