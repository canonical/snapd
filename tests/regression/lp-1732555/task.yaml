summary: installing a snap with unknown plugs and slots is harmless

details: |
    Users have painfully found that a version of snapd crashed when a snap
    contained unknown interfaces in either plugs or slots.

prepare: |
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-unknown-interfaces --devmode

execute: |
    echo "Snapd did not die on us"
    snap version
    echo "The snap was installed and can be used"
    test-snapd-unknown-interfaces -c true
    echo "The bogus plugs and slots are not added"
    snap interfaces | NOMATCH bogus-plug
    snap interfaces | NOMATCH bogus-slot
