summary: Regression test for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snap-confine/+bug/1644439
# NOTE: This test is excluded on core systems as the kernel release schedule
# there is separate from classic Ubuntu. Once the fixed kernel is available
# this line should be removed.
systems: [-ubuntu-core-16-*]

    snap-confine uses privately-shared /run/snapd/ns to store bind-mounted
    mount namespaces of each snap. In the case that snap-confine is invoked
    from the mount namespace it typically constructs, the said directory does
    not contain mount entries for preserved namespaces as those are only
    visible in the main, outer namespace. In order to operate in such an
    environment snap-confine must first re-associate its own process with
    another namespace in which the /run/snapd/ns directory is visible.
    The most obvious candidate is pid one, which definitely doesn't run in a
    snap-specific namespace, has a predictable PID and is long lived.
