summary: Regression test for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snap-confine/+bug/1644439
# This test fails on Ubuntu 18.04 and later because snap-confine, along all of
# snapd is built in a distribution from the future (ubuntu 18.04 for example)
# and the injected into a ubuntu 16.04-based chroot. This cannot work in
# general. We discussed this in the past and we'd have to change how we do our
# CI so that we can always build each branch against ubuntu 16.04 container and
# only then repackage and test on a given distribution.

systems: [ubuntu-14.04-64, ubuntu-16.04-32, ubuntu-16.04-64]

    snap-confine uses privately-shared /run/snapd/ns to store bind-mounted
    mount namespaces of each snap. In the case that snap-confine is invoked
    from the mount namespace it typically constructs, the said directory does
    not contain mount entries for preserved namespaces as those are only
    visible in the main, outer namespace. In order to operate in such an
    environment snap-confine must first re-associate its own process with
    another namespace in which the /run/snapd/ns directory is visible.
    The most obvious candidate is pid one, which definitely doesn't run in a
    snap-specific namespace, has a predictable PID and is long lived.
