    In this bug, an app belonging go a snap using classic confinement confuses
    the re-execution system in a way that causes distribution version of
    snap-confine to be used, instead of the one from the core snap. If the
    version outside and inside are different and incompatible the classily
    confined snap will malfunction.

    This specifically happens when the distribution uses snapd 2.25 and the
    core snap has snapd 2.26.9

    Testing is somewhat complex but we can approximate by observing the value
    of SNAP_DID_REEXEC as set inside the environment set up by snap run
    --shell.  Since neither snap-confine nor snap-exec re-execute themselves
    (instead they rely on snap run to run the right tool in the first place)
    this is safe to do.

execute: |
    . $TESTSLIB/snaps.sh
    install_local_classic test-snapd-classic-confinement
    # We don't want to see SNAP_DID_REEXEC being set.
    if snap run --shell test-snapd-classic-confinement ./snap-env-query.sh | grep 'SNAP_DID_REEXEC='; then
        echo "SNAP_DID_REEXEC environment is set - it should *not* be set ever"
        exit 1
    fi
