summary: services see proxy settings

details: |
    On Ubuntu Core systems, snapd provides a way to centrally manage the HTTP
    proxy, using the snap configuration system, on the reserved snap name
    "system". Due to a flaw, this setting was only visible to
    interactively-running application but not to services.

    The test sets the proxy and ensures it was visible to service provided by a
    snap package.

# Proxy settings are only honored on core systems.
systems: [ubuntu-core-*]

prepare: |
    snap set system proxy.http=http://example.com/
    MATCH http_proxy=http://example.com/ < /etc/environment
    snap pack test-snapd-service
    snap install --dangerous test-snapd-service_1_all.snap

restore: |
    snap unset system proxy.http

    MATCH http_proxy=http://example.com/ < /var/snap/test-snapd-service/common/env
