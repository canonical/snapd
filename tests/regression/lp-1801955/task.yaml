summary: Check that snapshot works with unknown users in /home/*/snap

details: |
    Snapd can create data snapshots containing per-user data for a particular
    snap. Normally those files are stored in the $HOME/snap directory (or the
    hidden alternative) but are made for all the users of the system. The way
    snapd enumerates users is complicated, but it relies on being able to find
    the name of the user. The test creates a directory that looks like a home
    directory of a user "potato", but the actual user is not in the static user
    database, causing snapd to skip archiving data from that "user" without
    failing.
