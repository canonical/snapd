summary: verify that python3 works in 18.04

details: |
    Snapd apparmor template contains logic that describes which of the files
    present in the base snap may be accessed. That list was briefly out-of-date
    when a transition to Python 3.9 to Python 3.10 meant that the rule would no
    longer match the double-digit version number that was visible in some
    directories.

    The test ensures that a snap based on Python 3.10 can start the Python
    interpreter and import the ssl module.

systems: [ubuntu-18.04-64]

execute: |
    echo "Install snaps"
    snap install test-snapd-sh-core22
    test-snapd-sh-core22.sh -c 'python3 -c "import ssl;print(ssl)"'|MATCH ssl.py
