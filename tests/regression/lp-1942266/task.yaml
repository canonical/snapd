summary: Regression test for LP 1942266

details: |
    Snapd has a state system which stores information about connected
    interfaces. The connection itself carries certain attributes and those
    attributes were being left stale, when one of the connected snaps were
    refreshed, bringing in with them updated values of the attribute. This was
    particularly problematic for the system-files loophole interface, as the
    "read" or "write" attributes contained a list of files or directories to
    expose to the connected snap

    This test installs and refreshes a snap to make sure that system-files works
    as expected both before and after the refresh. After the refresh the updated
    list of directories is respected by the system.

    This test is related to lp-1825883 which handles the case for "content"
    interface.
