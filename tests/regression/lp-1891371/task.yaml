summary: mount changes can happen while a bind-mount file is open

details: |
    Snapd has ability to bind-mount files between two snaps, using the content
    interface. When snapd is updating the mount namespace it will unmount the
    bind-mount. This operation may fail, like any unmount, if the accessed file
    is busy. Snapd was later updated to detach instead of unmounting, relying on
    kernel garbage collection logic to finish unmounting when no more references
    remain, and the file system can be cleanly unmounted.

prepare: |
    snap pack test-snapd-app
    snap pack test-snapd-extra-content

execute: |
    # This starts a service that opens /opt/foo via bind-file layout.
    snap install --dangerous ./test-snapd-app_1_all.snap
    tests.cleanup defer snap remove --purge test-snapd-app
    # This contains a content snap that does nothing and can be attached to the snap above.
    snap install --dangerous ./test-snapd-extra-content_1_all.snap
    tests.cleanup defer snap remove --purge test-snapd-extra-content
    # This attaches the content snap, forcing bind-file layout to be reconstructed.
    snap connect test-snapd-app:extra-content test-snapd-extra-content:extra-content
    tests.cleanup defer snap disconnect test-snapd-app:extra-content test-snapd-extra-content:extra-content
