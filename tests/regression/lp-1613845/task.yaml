summary: Check that /var/lib/lxd is bind mounted to the real thing if one exists
# This is blacklisted on debian because we first have to get the dpkg-vendor patches

    After switching to the chroot-based snap-confine the LXD snap stopped
    working (even in devmode) because it relied on access to /var/lib/lxd from
    the host filesystem. While this would never work in an all-snap image it is
    still important to ensure that it works in classic devmode environment.
prepare: |
    echo "Having installed the snapd-hacker-toolbelt snap in devmode"
    snap install --devmode snapd-hacker-toolbelt
    echo "Having created a canary file in /var/lib/lxd"
    mkdir -p /var/lib/lxd
    echo "test" > /var/lib/lxd/canary
execute: |
    cd /
    echo "We can see the canary file in /var/lib/lxd"
    [ "$(snapd-hacker-toolbelt.busybox cat /var/lib/lxd/canary)" = "test" ]
restore: |
    snap remove snapd-hacker-toolbelt
    rm -f /var/lib/lxd/canary
    # When the host already has LXD installed we cannot just remove this
    rmdir /var/lib/lxd || :
