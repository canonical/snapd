summary: Check that /var/lib/lxd is bind mounted to the real thing if one exists
details: |
    After switching to the chroot-based snap-confine the LXD snap stopped
    working (even in devmode) because it relied on access to /var/lib/lxd from
    the host filesystem. While this would never work in an all-snap image it is
    still important to ensure that it works in classic devmode environment.
