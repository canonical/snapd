summary: Regression test for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snap-confine/+bug/1607796

details: |
    During construction of the snap execution environment, the snap-confine
    program runs under apparmor confinement and needs to have permission to
    mount the /root directory from the host system into the snap execution
    environment being constructed. If snap-confine lacks permission to mount
    that directory a snap running in devmode, with non-enforced confinement,
    would not be able to see any files in the /root directory as seen from
    the perspective of the running snap application.

prepare: |
    echo "Having installed a test snap in devmode"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-tools --devmode
    echo "Having added a canary file in /root"
    echo "test" > /root/canary

restore: |
    rm -f /root/canary

execute: |
    echo "We can see the canary file in /root"
    [ "$(test-snapd-tools.cmd cat /root/canary)" = "test" ]
