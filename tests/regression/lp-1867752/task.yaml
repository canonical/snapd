summary: certain layout configuration prevents snapd from removing a snap

details: |
    Snapd attempts to update preserved mount namespaces when the per-snap mount
    profile is changed by interface connection changes, snap refreshes or even
    base snap refreshes. The exact way in which this is done is very complex and
    over time, a simpler method was devised, where bulk of the changes are
    undone and the namespace is re-constructed with the minimal attempt to
    reuse.

    Even with the simpler method we realized that part of the tear-down logic
    would possibly attempt to remove a directory or file that is coming from
    a squashfs - failing with EROFS. The part of snapd responsible for mount
    namespace updates was made aware of that corner-case and the error would
    not longer cause issues with snap package removal.

    Historically this test also enabled the robust-mount-namespace-updates feature,
    but it is now enabled by default.
