summary: Checks basic network-manager/nmcli functionality

description: |
  Test regression caused by seccomp argument filtering getting
  stricter but the network-manager plug side was not updated
  to include "socket AF_NETLINK - NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT" which
  is vital for nmcli to work.

systems: [ubuntu-core-*]

execute: |
    echo "Install network-manager and do basic smoke test"
    snap install network-manager

    # using wait_for_service is not enough, systemd considers
    # the service active even when it is not (yet) listening to
    # dbus
