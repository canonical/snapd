summary: system key mismatch is ignored on reboot/shutdown

details: |
    Snapd uses the system key concept to know when the outside environment has
    changed in an important way, that requires security profiles to be
    re-compiled. Certain parts of the snap-{run,confine,exec} toolchain are able
    to detect system key mismatch and wait for the system key to match before
    proceeding.

    We found that in certain cases, this can block shutdown of the system, where
    the system is shutting down, snapd has shut down but we are attempting to
    shut down a service, which may have additional commands to run on stop.

    The test creates this scenario and makes sure that the system key logic is
    aware of the shutdown.
