summary: docker-support and multipass-support should mount base /etc/apparmor.d

details: |
    Snap interfaces "docker-support" and "multipass-support" are highly
    privileged and allow interacting with apparmor itself. Applications using
    those interfaces are most likely interested in compiling and attaching
    apparmor profiles, and this needs access to meaningful content stored in
    /etc/apparmor and /etc/apparmor.d directories.

    Since the /etc directory is shared from the host, that directory may not
    have any apparmor related content whatsoever, the aforementioned interfaces
    grew special ability to hide the two directories from host's /etc and
    replace them with static content from the base snap instead.

    The test uses both interfaces and ensures that the directories, according to
    fstatfs(2), are squashfs.

# no nsenter on ubuntu-14.04
# core16 uses "legacy" mount layout and does not mount /etc/apparmor{,d} as it's
# not pivoting to a base snap to begin with.
systems: [-ubuntu-14.04-*, -ubuntu-core-16-*]
