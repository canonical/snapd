summary: Regression check for https://bugs.launchpad.net/snap-confine/+bug/1630479
details: |
    The PATH environment variable needs to make sense for the layout of the
    core snap. Snap-confine contains code that sets it accordingly but during
    the introduction of the namespace sharing feature that code would run only
    when the namespace was initially constructed. Subsequent calls would not
    see the correct path.

    echo "We can observe the value of PATH twice"

    two="$(test-snapd-tools.cmd sh -c 'echo $PATH')"
    echo "We can see that PATH is stable across calls"
    [ "$one" = "$two" ]
    echo "We can make sure that it has the right value"
    [ "$one" = "/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games" ]
    # NOTE: the following parts are notably absent from PATH
    #  - /snap/test-snapd-tools/$revision/bin
    #  - /snap/test-snapd-tools/$revision/usr/bin
    #
    # This is because our test snap is not built with snapcraft and those path
    # elements are only added by the wrappers generated by snapcraft.
