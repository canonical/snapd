summary: Check that user namespace can be unshared within snap apps 
# This is blacklisted on debian because we first have to get the dpkg-vendor patches
systems: [-debian-8]
details: |
    Snap-confine used to "leak" the root filesystem directory across the
    pivot_root call. This caused checks in the kernel to fail and resulted in
    the inability to create user namespaces from sufficiently privileged or
    devmode snaps.

    echo "Having installed the snapd-hacker-toolbelt snap in devmode"
    snap install --devmode snapd-hacker-toolbelt

    echo "We can run unshare -U as a regular user and expect it to work"
    /snap/bin/snapd-hacker-toolbelt.busybox sh -c 'unshare -U true'
restore: |
    snap remove snapd-hacker-toolbelt
