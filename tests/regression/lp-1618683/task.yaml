summary: Check that user namespace can be unshared within snap apps

details: |
    Snap-confine used to "leak" the root filesystem directory across the
    pivot_root call. This caused checks in the kernel to fail and resulted in
    the inability to create user namespaces from sufficiently privileged or
    devmode snaps.

prepare: |
    echo "Having installed a test snap in devmode"
    . "$TESTSLIB/snaps.sh"
    install_local_devmode test-snapd-tools

execute: |
    echo "We can run unshare -U as a regular user and expect it to work"
    test-snapd-tools.cmd unshare -U true
