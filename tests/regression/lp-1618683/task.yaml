summary: Check that user namespace can be unshared within snap apps 
details: |
    Snap-confine used to "leak" the root filesystem directory across the
    pivot_root call. This caused checks in the kernel to fail and resulted in
    the inability to create user namespaces from sufficiently privileged or
    devmode snaps.
