summary: verify that parallel instances of snaps with complex layout are correct

details: |
    The layout in https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1906821 would be broken
    with parallel instances, as due to a bug in sorting of mount entries, the
    mapping of /var/snap/aws-iot-greengrass_prime to /var/snap/aws-iot-greengrass
    was established too late. Layout entries referring to $SNAP_DATA would access
    content from real /var/snap/aws-iot-greengrass instead of the instance one.
