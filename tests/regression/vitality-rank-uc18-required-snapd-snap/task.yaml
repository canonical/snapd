summary: UC18 systems with vitality-rank services were generated incorrectly

details: |
    Snapd defined the concept of "vitality rank" which is used by the
    out-of-memory killer to ensure that certain processes are more likely to be
    sacrificed when memory is tight, and that other processes are more likely to
    survive.

    Due to a bug in earlier version of snapd, the vitality rank was resulting in
    an incorrect re-mapping of the snapd feature to a systemd feature, causing
    failure.

    Check that using vitality hint does not break the systemd service unit of
    the snap application configured to use it.
