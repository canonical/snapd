summary: Ensure snapd builds correctly in sbuild

details: |
    The Debian package of snapd is sensitive to new dependencies that are not
    provided as other Debian packages. We prefer to discover build issues
    during the development process, and not during the final stages of release
    preparation.

    This nightly test builds the Debian package, using the packaging/debian-sid
    directory, in a manner that is similar to what happens in the Debian buildd
    network.

    Additional tooling is provided to iteratively and incrementally work on the
    packaging process, so that failures are easier to investigate.

    Use release-tools/debian-package-builder to interactively fix build
    issues. The debug shell created there shows the true layout of the source
    code as it exists during the build inside a debian system, inside the
    environment created by sbuild.

    In particular note that the source code exists twice in the build tree,
    and only the specific copy is being used.
