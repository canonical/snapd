summary: Ensure that the openvswitch interface works.

details: |
    The openvswitch interface allows to task to the openvswitch socket (rw mode).

    A snap which defines a openvswitch plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to do all the operations that
    are carried through the socket, in this test we exercise bridge and port creation,
    list and deletion.
