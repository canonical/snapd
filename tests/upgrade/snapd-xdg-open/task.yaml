summary: Verify snapd-xdg-open package is properly replaced with the snapd one

details: |
    snapd-xdg-open was formerly provided by the snapd-xdg-open package
    and is now part of the snapd package. This test case verifies that
    the snapd-xdg-open package from the archive is properly replaced.
# Test case only applies to Ubuntu as that is the only distribution where
# we had a snapd-xdg-open package ever.

systems: [-ubuntu-core-*, -debian-*, -ubuntu-14.04-*, -fedora-*, -arch-*, -amazon-*, -centos-*]
