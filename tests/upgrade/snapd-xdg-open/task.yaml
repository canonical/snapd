summary: Verify snapd-xdg-open package is properly replaced with the snapd one
description: |
    snapd-xdg-open was formerly provided by the snapd-xdg-open package
    and is now part of the snapd package. This test case verifies that
    the snapd-xdg-open package from the archive is properly replaced.
# Test case only applies to Ubuntu as that is the only distribution where
# we had a snapd-xdg-open package ever.
systems: [ubuntu-*, -ubuntu-core-*]
