summary: Ensure conffile removal from upgrades <2.46 works

details: |
    Ensure that upgrading from 2.45.1 works and conffile cleanup for
    /etc/sudoers.d/99-snapd.conf happens.
    
    The exact version of snapd is a bit arbitrary (anything before
    2.46 is fine).

systems: [ubuntu-20.04-64]

execute: |
    echo "download snapd 2.45.1"
    wget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapd/2.45.1/+build/19499801/+files/snapd_2.45.1_amd64.deb
    apt install -y --allow-downgrades ./snapd_2.45*_amd64.deb

    echo "Check that the sudoers.d conffile is there"
    test -e /etc/sudoers.d/99-snapd.conf
    
    echo "upgrade to current snapd"
    apt install -y "$GOHOME"/snapd*.deb

    echo "Check that the conffile is gone after the upgrade (LP: 1915156)"
    test ! -e /etc/sudoers.d/99-snapd.conf
