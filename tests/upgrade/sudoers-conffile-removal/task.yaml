summary: Ensure conffile removal from upgrades <2.46 works

details: |
    Ensure that upgrading from 2.45.1 works and conffile cleanup for
    /etc/sudoers.d/99-snapd.conf happens.

    The exact version of snapd is a bit arbitrary (anything before
    2.46 is fine).

systems: [ubuntu-2*]

    if not os.query is-pc-amd64; then
