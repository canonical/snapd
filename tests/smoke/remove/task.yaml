summary: Check that install/remove works

details: |
    Snapd installs packages by mounting them in a structure under /snap or
    /var/lib/snapd/snap directories, depending on distribution policy. Ensure
    that a trivial test snap can be installed and removed, and that after
    removal no leftovers remain in the mounting area.

execute: |
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-sh

    SNAP_MOUNT_DIR="$(os.paths snap-mount-dir)"
    test -d "$SNAP_MOUNT_DIR/test-snapd-sh"

    echo "Ensure remove works"
    snap remove test-snapd-sh
    test ! -d "$SNAP_MOUNT_DIR/test-snapd-sh"

    if snap list test-snapd-sh; then
        echo "test-snapd-sh should be removed but it is not"
        snap list
        exit 1
    fi
