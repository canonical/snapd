summary: Check that find works correctly

details: |
  Snapd offers a way to search the snap store using the "snap find" command.
  Ensure that we can find a test snap called test-snapd-tools and that we can
  display detailed information about it by using the "snap info" command.

execute: |
  echo "Ensure 'snap find' works"
  snap find test-snapd-tools | MATCH ^test-snapd-tools

  echo "Ensure we can see useful info for it"
  snap info test-snapd-tools | MATCH '^name:\ +test-snapd-tools'
