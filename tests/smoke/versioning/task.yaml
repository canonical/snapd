summary: Check that the version is not dirty

details: |
    Snapd has a script that generates the version string based on the Debian
    changelog file or on Git history, and the status of the git repository. When
    Git-based version is computed, it could contain the word "dirty" if the
    working directory contains uncommitted changes. We want to make sure this
    doesn't happen in CI, where it could indicate that part of the tests
    modified the code in unintended ways.

execute: |
    # TODO: fix dirty version number on riscv
    echo "Ensure the version number is not 'dirty'"
    if not uname -m | MATCH riscv64; then
        snap version | NOMATCH dirty
    fi
