summary: Check version content.

    Check that snap version output is as expected.

    Snapd has a script that generates the version string based on the Debian
    changelog file or on Git history, and the status of the git repository. When
    Git-based version is computed, it could contain the word "dirty" if the
    working directory contains uncommitted changes. We want to make sure this
    doesn't happen in CI, where it could indicate that part of the tests
    modified the code in unintended ways.

    snap version > version.out
    # does not fail, even though --verbose does not affect the output currently
    snap version --verbose > version-verbose.out
