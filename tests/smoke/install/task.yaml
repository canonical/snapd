summary: Check that installing and running a snap works

details: |
    Snapd installs packages by mounting them in a structure under /snap or
    /var/lib/snapd/snap directories, depending on distribution policy. Ensure
    that a trivial test snap can be installed, shows up in the list of installed
    packages, can be started as both root and non-root user and that a snapd
    state recorded that installation in the change system. The test snap is
    installed, and partially tested (only as root) for each of the major base
    snaps: core, core18, core20 and core22.

restore: |
    rm -f /home/test/stderr.log
    rm -f /home/test/stdout.log
    # required! in autopkgtest no suite restore is run at all
    snap remove --purge test-snapd-sh

        cat stderr.log
