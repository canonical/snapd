summary: A more complex snap for testing content interface 
version: 1.0
apps:
    sh:
        command: bin/sh
plugs:
    # NOTE: The following content interface relies on the fact that when
    # content interface attribute "content" is not provided it defaults to the
    # plug or slot name. In effect the "data" plug has the "content" attribute
    # set to "data" and this matches the slot definitions in
    # test-snapd-content-advanced-slot. The same is true for "common" and
    # "snap".
    data:
        interface: content
        target: $SNAP_DATA/target
    common:
        interface: content
        target: $SNAP_COMMON/target
    snap:
        interface: content
        target: $SNAP/target
