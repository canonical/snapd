    # NOTE: The following content interface relies on the fact that when
    # content interface attribute "content" is not provided it defaults to the
    # plug or slot name. In effect the "data" plug has the "content" attribute
    # set to "data" and this matches the slot definitions in
    # test-snapd-content-advanced-slot. The same is true for "common" and
    # "snap".
