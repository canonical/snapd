summary: An empty snap with only a local and store icon
description: |
  An empty snap containing only an icon to be included at meta/gui/icon.svg.
  The snap has a store icon which differs from the local icon file. Used to
  test that snapd prioritizes a local icon file in the snap over the cached
  store icon.

# Store icon: icon-orange-wing.svg
# Local icon: icon-orange-chest.svg

# Don't use the icon field, as this will set meta/gui/icon.svg and the store
# icon to be the same thing, and we want them to be different so we can test
# that the icon file in the snap is prioritized over the cached store icon.
# icon: icon-orange-wing.svg
