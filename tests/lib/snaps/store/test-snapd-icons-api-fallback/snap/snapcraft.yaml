summary: An empty snap with only a store icon
description: |
  An empty snap which only has a store icon. Used to test that snapd caches the
  store icon for the snap on download and serves it over the icons API, since
  no icon is present at meta/gui/icon.*.

grade: stable
confinement: strict

# Store icon: icon-orange-tail.svg
# Local icon: none

# Don't use the icon field, as this will copy the icon to meta/gui/icon.svg,
# and we want there to be no icon file in the snap so we can test that snapd
# falls back to the cached store icon when no local icon is present.
# icon: icon-orange-tail.svg
