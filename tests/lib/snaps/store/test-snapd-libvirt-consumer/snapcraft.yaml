summary: Basic snap declaring a plug on the libvirt interface

description: |
    Apart from consuming the libvirt interface this snap packages a tiny vm
    to be run with libvirt and be able to run some checks. The vm is a solo5
    unikernel which is built during snap creation.

    As a prerrequisite, a tap interface must be available for the vm to be
    connected, the default name is tap100 and can be created with
        ip tuntap add tap100 mode tap
        ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev tap100
        ip link set dev tap100 up

    With this in place, the vm would be accessible at 10.0.0.2

    Once you execute machine-up, the vm will respond to ping requests.
