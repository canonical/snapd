summary: Sample illustrating very basic layout support
apps:
    sh:
        command: ../../../bin/sh
layout:
  # Layouts can be used to inject configuration files and directories.
  /etc/demo:
    bind: $SNAP_COMMON/etc/demo
  /etc/demo.conf:
    bind-file: $SNAP_COMMON/etc/demo.conf
  /etc/demo.cfg:
    symlink: $SNAP_COMMON/etc/demo.conf
  # Layouts can be used to remap $SNAP paths to work around hard-coded locations.
  /usr/share/demo:
    bind: $SNAP/usr/share/demo
  # Layouts can be used to remap $SNAP_DATA to work around hard-coded locations
  /var/lib/demo:
    bind: $SNAP_DATA/var/lib/demo
  /var/cache/demo:
    bind: $SNAP_DATA/var/cache/demo
  # Layouts can help with applications designed for /opt
  /opt/demo:
    bind: $SNAP/opt/demo
  # Layouts can poke holes and preserve DAC permissions while doing so
  # notably /var/spool/rsyslog is owned by syslog:adm and has mode 700
  /var/spool/rsyslog/demo:
    bind: $SNAP_DATA/var/spool/rsyslog/demo
  # Layout can refer to non-existing source path.
  /bin/very/weird/place:
    bind: $SNAP/bin/very/weird/place
