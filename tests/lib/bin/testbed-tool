# This script is meant to monitor the state of the device under test.  It is a
# convenient place to add detectors for leaky tests. Things that fit into this
# category are:
# - leftover mount points (now sporadically captured by tests/main/mount-ns)
# - leftover processes (especially FUSE things or dbus-daemon)
# - leftover packages
# - altered kernel control knobs.
