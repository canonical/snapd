This directory include the rules files used to determine which
tests have to be executed based on a list of changed files.

Each rules file is used depending on the system being evaluated.
This is an example of rules:

rules:
  RULE_NAME_1:
    from: [FROM_LIST]
    to: [TO_LIST]

  RULE_NAME_2:
    ...

where:
RULE_NAME_1: is a descriptive name of the specific rule
FROM_LIST: is a list of python regex used to determine if a file matches this rule
TO_LIST: is a list of spread tests to run in case a change matches a regex from the FROM_LIST

The spread-filter tool, based on the list of changes, determine which tests need to
be executed. For each changed file, the spread-filter will use the TO_LIST for the first rule
matching it. 

Finally, the spread-filter calculates the union of all the tests and prints all the tests to
be executed.

In case the FROM_LIST is [.*], this means that any change match this rule. This
can be used for example as the last rule to make sure that the changes which didn't match any
rule are matched by the last one. 

In case the TO_LIST includes the value $SELF, means that in case of a test, just
this test is executed.
