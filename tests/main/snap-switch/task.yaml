summary: Ensure that the snap switch command works

details: |
    The switch command switches the given snap to a different channel without
    doing a refresh. All available channels of a snap are listed in
    its 'snap info' output.

    This test switches the snap channel from stable to edge by using the
    `snap switch` command. Also it is verified that we don't print
    incorrect and confusing information.

execute: |
    echo "Having test-snapd-sh snap installed using stable channel"
    snap install test-snapd-sh
    snap info test-snapd-sh | MATCH "tracking: +latest/stable"

    echo "Run the snap switch command using the edge channel"
    snap switch --edge test-snapd-sh > stdout.txt
    snap info test-snapd-sh | MATCH "tracking: +latest/edge"

    echo "Ensure we don't print incorrect and confusing information"
    not grep "is closed; temporarily forwarding to stable." < stdout.txt
