summary: Check that snap disconnect works

details: |
    This test verifies multiple ways to invoke "snap disconnect". It
    can disconnect specific connections, or all connections to a plug,
    or a slot. Forgetting connection should be correctly saved. Both
    connections to snapd and other snaps can be disconnected.

environment:
    SNAP_FILE: "home-consumer_1.0_all.snap"
