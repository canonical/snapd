details: |
    The "snap known" command allows to query the store for assertions that have
    particular properties, such as assertion type. Those assertions do not need
    to be in the snapd assertion store on the local system.

execute: |
    echo "Check getting assertion from the store"
    output=$(snap known --remote model series=16 brand-id=canonical model=pi2)
    echo "$output" |MATCH "type: model"
    echo "$output" |MATCH "series: 16"
    echo "$output" |MATCH "brand-id: canonical"
    echo "$output" |MATCH "model: pi2"
