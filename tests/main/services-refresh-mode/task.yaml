summary: Check that refresh-modes works

details: |
    Snapd maintains the process id when a service snap is refreshed.
    The test verifies that if we install and refresh the test-snapd-service
    snap, the service keeps the process id. Also it checks the service is
    stopped when the snap is removed.
