summary: Check that refresh-modes works

details: |
    Snapd services can be configured to control whether should be restarted
    during a snap refresh through the refresh-mode option. The available options
    to configure are: restart , endure, (do not restart) or ignore-running 
    (does not refresh running services to facilitate the refresh app awareness feature)
    
    This test refreshes the test-snapd-service snap and checks the service
    test-snapd-endure-service which is configured with 'refresh-mode: endure'
    is not restarted during the refresh (keeps the same pid).
