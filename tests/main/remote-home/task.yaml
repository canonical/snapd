summary: Test that snaps still work when /home is a remote mount

details: |
    Snapd now contains a feature where NFS-mounted or CIFS-mounted /home (or
    any sub-directory) initializes a workaround mode where all snaps gain
    minimal amount of network permissions sufficient for the file system to
    operate.

# Limit the test to systems that have samba fairly new samba and fairly
# painless NFS. The effect of remote home is limited to additional apparmor
# permissions, so testing on one apparmor-enabled system should be enough.
#
# The test focuses on the side-effects of an already mounted filesystem, and
# not on detection of NFS from fstab or similar, as that part is tested with
# unit tests and is relatively useless in the field, where way more elaborate
# logic is used in practice (e.g. PAM modules), that snapd has no support for.
