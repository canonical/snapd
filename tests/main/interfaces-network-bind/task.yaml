summary: Ensure that the network-bind interface works

systems: [-debian-*]

details: |
    The network-bind interface allows a daemon to access the network as a server.

    A snap which defines the network-bind plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be accessible by a network client.

environment:
    SNAP_NAME: network-bind-consumer
    SNAP_FILE: ${SNAP_NAME}_1.0_all.snap
    PORT: 8081
    REQUEST_FILE: ./request.txt

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring the network-bind plug is installed"
    snapbuild $TESTSLIB/snaps/$SNAP_NAME .
    snap install --dangerous $SNAP_FILE

    echo "Given the snap's service is listening"
    while ! netstat -lnt | grep -Pq "tcp.*?:$PORT +.*?LISTEN\n*"; do sleep 0.5; done

    echo "Given we store a basic HTTP request"
    cat > $REQUEST_FILE <<EOF
    GET / HTTP/1.0

    EOF

    rm -f $SNAP_FILE $REQUEST_FILE
