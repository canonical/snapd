summary: Ensure that the network-bind interface works

details: |
    The network-bind interface allows a daemon to access the network as a server.

    A snap which defines the network-bind plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be accessible by a network client.

environment:
    SNAP_NAME: network-bind-consumer
    PORT: 8081
    REQUEST_FILE: ./request.txt

prepare: |
    . "$TESTSLIB/snaps.sh"

    echo "Given a snap declaring the network-bind plug is installed"
    install_local $SNAP_NAME

    echo "Given the snap's service is listening"
    while ! netstat -lnt | grep -Pq "tcp.*?:$PORT +.*?LISTEN\n*"; do sleep 0.5; done

    echo "Given we store a basic HTTP request"
    cat > $REQUEST_FILE <<EOF
    GET / HTTP/1.0

    EOF

execute: |
    echo "The interface is connected by default"
    snap interfaces | MATCH ":network-bind .*$SNAP_NAME"

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect $SNAP_NAME:network-bind

    echo "Then the plug can be connected again"
    snap connect $SNAP_NAME:network-bind

    echo "Then the service is accessible by a client"
    nc -w 2 localhost "$PORT" < $REQUEST_FILE | grep -Pqz "ok\n"

    if [ "$(snap debug confinement)" = partial ] ; then
        exit 0
    fi

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect $SNAP_NAME:network-bind

    echo "Then the service is not accessible by a client"
    response=$(nc -w 2 localhost "$PORT" < $REQUEST_FILE)
    [ "$response" = "" ]
