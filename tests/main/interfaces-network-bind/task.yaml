summary: Ensure that the network-bind interface works

details: |
    The network-bind interface allows a daemon to access the network as a server.

    A snap which defines the network-bind plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be accessible by a network client.

environment:
    SNAP_NAME: network-bind-consumer
    PORT: 8081
    REQUEST_FILE: ./request.txt

prepare: |
    #shellcheck source=tests/lib/snaps.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB/snaps.sh"

    echo "Given a snap declaring the network-bind plug is installed"
    install_local "$SNAP_NAME"

    echo "Given the snap's service is listening"
    # shellcheck source=tests/lib/network.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB"/network.sh
    wait_listen_port "$PORT"

    echo "Given we store a basic HTTP request"
    cat > "$REQUEST_FILE" <<EOF
    GET / HTTP/1.0

    EOF

restore: |
    # This snap is removed because it generates thousands of DENIALS in the journal. Most of those
    # are sent after the journalctl cursor for following test is determined producing errors while
    # preparing the test.
    snap remove network-bind-consumer

execute: |
    echo "The interface is connected by default"
    snap interfaces -i network-bind | MATCH ":network-bind .*$SNAP_NAME"

    echo "Then the service is accessible by a client"
    nc -w 2 localhost "$PORT" < "$REQUEST_FILE" | grep -Pqz 'ok\n'

    if [ "$(snap debug confinement)" = partial ] ; then
        exit 0
    fi

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect "$SNAP_NAME:network-bind"

    echo "Then the service is not accessible by a client"
    response=$(nc -w 2 localhost "$PORT" < "$REQUEST_FILE")
    [ "$response" = "" ]

    echo "Then the plug can be connected again"
    snap connect "$SNAP_NAME:network-bind"
