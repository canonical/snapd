summary: snapctl is usable in snaps with bare base

details: |
  The bare snap has no dynamic linker, no libraries and no programs. It's even
  barren enough that there's no symbolic link that points to snapctl that is
  found on PATH. Despite all of that, a snap can call snapctl with full path
  and use its services.

prepare: |
  snap install test-snapd-busybox-static

execute: |
  test-snapd-busybox-static.busybox-static sh -c 'exec /usr/lib/snapd/snapctl --help' | MATCH 'snapctl \[OPTIONS\] <command>'
