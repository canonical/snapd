summary: Verify paths are correctly reported

details: |
    This test checks that the command `snap debug paths` shows
    the correct paths for the SNAPD_MOUNT, SNAPD_BIN and SNAPD_LIBEXEC
    environment variables. 

execute: |
    SNAP_MOUNT_DIR="$(os.paths snap-mount-dir)"
    LIBEXEC_DIR="$(os.paths libexec-dir)"

    snap debug paths | MATCH "^SNAPD_MOUNT=${SNAP_MOUNT_DIR}$"
    snap debug paths | MATCH "^SNAPD_BIN=${SNAP_MOUNT_DIR}/bin$"
    snap debug paths | MATCH "^SNAPD_LIBEXEC=${LIBEXEC_DIR}/snapd$"

    # double check we can eval it as shell
    eval "$(snap debug paths)"
    test "${SNAPD_MOUNT}" = "${SNAP_MOUNT_DIR}"
