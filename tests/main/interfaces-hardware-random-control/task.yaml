summary: Ensure that the hardware-random-control interface works.

summary: |
    The hardware-observe interface allows a snap to access hardware-random information.

    A snap which access to the hardware-random information must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be connected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to read files in
    /sys/class/misc/hw_random/{rng_available,rng_current}
