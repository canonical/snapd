summary: Ensure that the hardware-udev-control interface works.

details: |
    The hardware-udev-control interface allows a snap to use udevadm to control udev daemon.

    A snap which has access to the hardware-udev-control must be shown
    in the interfaces list. The plug must not be connected on install
    and, as usual, must be able to be reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to connect
    and write to /run/udev/control and /sys/**/uevent files.

# Execution skipped on debian, arch and amazon due to device /dev/hwrng not
# created by default
systems: [-debian-*, -arch-*, -amazon-*, -centos-*]
