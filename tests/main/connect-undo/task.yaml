    echo "Installing a revision with broken connect hook fails"

    echo "Installing a revision with no hook"
    snap install --dangerous test-connect_1_all.snap

    echo "Installing the broken revision without triggering connect hook"
    # this works because an older revision was installed and we don't re-connect
    # existing connections.
    snap install --dangerous test-connect_2_all.snap

    snap disconnect test-connect:home

    echo "Triggering connect hook"
    # this fails because of connect hook
