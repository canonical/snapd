prepare: |
    snap pack test-connect.v1
    snap pack test-connect.v2

execute: |
    #shellcheck source=tests/lib/snaps.sh

    echo "Installing a revision with broken connect hook fails"
    snap install --dangerous test-connect_2_all.snap 2>&1 | MATCH 'failure of connect hook'
    snap list | not MATCH test-connect

    echo "Installing a revision with no hook"
    snap install --dangerous test-connect_1_all.snap

    echo "Installing the broken revision without triggering connect hook"
    # this works because an older revision was installed and we don't re-connect
    # existing connections.
    snap install --dangerous test-connect_2_all.snap

    snap disconnect test-connect:network

    echo "Triggering connect hook"
    # this fails because of connect hook
