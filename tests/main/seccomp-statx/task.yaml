summary: the statx system call is not blocked by seccomp

details: |
    The statx(2) system call is a relatively new addition and is not
    available on each kernel but should not be blocked by seccomp
    when the kernel implements it

# This test will only pass on systems with seccomp 2.3.3 or newer which
# is available on all Ubuntu LTS releases.
systems: [ubuntu-16.04-*, ubuntu-18.04-*, ubuntu-2*]

prepare: |
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-statx

execute: |
    # Notably, this doesn't print statx: blocked anymore
    test-snapd-statx | MATCH 'statx: (supported|missing)'
