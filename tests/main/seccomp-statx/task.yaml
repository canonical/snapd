summary: the statx system call is not blocked by seccomp
details: |
    The statx(2) system call is a relatively new addition and is not
    available on each kernel but should not be blocked by seccomp
    when the kernel implements it
# This test will only pass on Ubuntu 18.10 and on other systems with seccomp
# 2.3.3 or newer. Eventually with some tricks we should be able to support all
# systems but for the purpose of snapd 2.36 this is the best we can do.
systems: [ubuntu-18.10-*]
prepare: |
    #shellcheck source=tests/lib/snaps.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB"/snaps.sh
    install_local test-snapd-statx
execute: |
    # Notably, this doesn't print statx: blocked anymore
    test-snapd-statx | MATCH 'statx: (supported|missing)'
