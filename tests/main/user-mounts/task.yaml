summary: smoke tests for user mounts

details: |
    When a confined snap has a user-fstab file, additional bind mounts will
    be performed prior to running the application.  These mounts are private
    to the invocation of the application, so can be used to manipulate how
    per-user data is presented.

# This test makes use of the user mount provided by the desktop
# interface.  When we have an interface providing user mounts that is
# available on core, we can switch to that.
# TODO: expand coverage to 14.04 with improved tests.session.
systems:
    - -ubuntu-core-*   # see above
    - -ubuntu-14.04-*  # no tests.session
