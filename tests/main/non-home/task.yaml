summary: Ensure running on none /home dirs gives a useful error

details: |
    Snap applications execute in a mount namespace that is quite different from
    that of the host system. Traditional system put user accounts in /home, with
    the exception of the root account at /root. The start-up program for snap
    applications, snap-confine, sets up the mount namespace so that the /home
    and /root directories from the host are represented in the snap mount
    namespace.

    Once snapd has become more popular, two problems were encountered. Some
    systems are configured in a quite unusual way, with seemingly random
    directories in /, like /home2, are encountered in the field. In response, in
    absence of a perfect solution, snapd was extended to display a message that
    such configuration is just not supported.

    The test creates conditions sufficient for the message to be displayed and
    measures it.
