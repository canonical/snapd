summary: Check that health works

details: |
    Snaps can provide a check-health hook that can be used by developers to signal to the
    system and the user that something is not well with the snap. Note the health is of the
    snap, not of the apps it contains; it's up to the snap developer to determine how the
    health of the individual apps add up to the health of the snap as a whole.

    This test installs a snap with a check-health hook which sets the health with
    'snapctl set-health okay'. Then it verifies that the value of 
    .data.health.<SNAP>.status in the state.json file is set to 1.
    It also checks that a snap app and a snap hook (other than check-health) can
    run 'snapctl set-health' and change the health value and message.

    snap install --edge jq

execute: |
    echo "Test that 'try'ing a snap with a set-health hook sets health in state:"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snapd-state check-state '.data.health."test-snapd-health"' = "null"
    snap try test-snapd-health
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snapd-state check-state '.data.health."test-snapd-health".status' = "1"
    # TODO: also check for health in info etc
    # TODO: also check installing from store

    echo "Test that a snap app can run 'snapctl set-health':"
    test-snapd-health error "Something went wrong"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snapd-state check-state '.data.health."test-snapd-health".message' = "Something went wrong"

    echo "Test that a snap hook (different from check-health) can run 'snapctl set-health':"
    snap set test-snapd-health force-health=okay
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snapd-state check-state '.data.health."test-snapd-health".status' = "1"
