summary: Check that health works

details: |
    Snaps can provide a check-health hook that can be used by developers to signal to the
    system and the user that something is not well with the snap. Note the health is of the
    snap, not of the apps it contains; it's up to the snap developer to determine how the
    health of the individual apps add up to the health of the snap as a whole.

    In this test it is installed a snap with a check-health hook which sets the health
    'snapctl set-health okay', then it is is verified that in the state.json file, the
    value for .data.health.<SNAP>.status is set to 1.
    Also it is checked that a snap app and a snap hook (different from check-health) can
    run 'snapctl set-health' and change the health value and message.
