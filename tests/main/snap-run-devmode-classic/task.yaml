summary: Ensure snap run inside a devmode snap works (for now)

details: |
    This test ensures inside a devmode snap the "snap run" command
    works.

    Because of historic mistakes we allowed this and until we properly
    deprecated it we need to ensure it works. We really do not want to
    support running other snaps from devmode snaps as the use-case for
    devmode is to get help on the way to confined snaps. But snaps can
    not run other snaps so this does not make sense.

systems:
    # run the classic test on xenial so that we can build the snapd snap
    # destructively without needing the lxd snap and thus execute much quicker
    # NOTE: if this test is moved to classic impish or later before the snapd
    # snap moves off of building based on xenial, then building with LXD will
    # not work because xenial containers do not boot/get networking properly
    # when the host has cgroupsv2 in it
    - ubuntu-16.04-*

environment:
    # to build natively on the machine rather than with multipass or lxd
    SNAPCRAFT_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT: host

    # ensure that re-exec is on by default like it should be
    SNAP_REEXEC: "1"

    SNAP_TO_USE_FIRST/snapd_first: snapd
