summary: Ensure that adb-support creates udev rules
details: |
    Connecting the adb-support plug to a matching slot adds appropriate udev
    rules to the system. Before such connection is placed there are no
    wide-open, write-access rules present.
prepare: |
    #shellcheck source=tests/lib/snaps.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB"/snaps.sh
    install_local test-snapd-adb-support
execute: |
    # If there are any udev rules from existing snaps they are not granting
    # writable-to-all permission to anything. This part is conditional because
    # some systems have the network manager installed and such systems will get
    # additional rules.
