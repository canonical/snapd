summary: Ensure that adb-support creates udev rules

details: |
    Connecting the adb-support plug to a matching slot adds appropriate udev
    rules to the system. Before such connection is placed there are no
    wide-open, write-access rules present.

prepare: |
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-adb-support

execute: |
    echo "Check initially there are not udev rules granting writable-to-all permission to anything"
    # If there are any udev rules from existing snaps they are not granting
    # writable-to-all permission to anything. This part is conditional because
    # some systems have the network manager installed and such systems will get
    # additional rules.
    if [ "$(find /etc/udev/rules.d -name '70-snap.*.rules' | wc -l)" -gt 0 ]; then
        NOMATCH adb-support /etc/udev/rules.d/70-snap.*.rules
        NOMATCH 'MODE="0666"' /etc/udev/rules.d/70-snap.*.rules
    fi

    snap connect test-snapd-adb-support:adb-support

    echo "Once the snap is connected there are adb-support udev rules that grant write-all permissions."
