summary: ensure unapproved user cannot be used with system-usernames

details: |
    Snapd has limited capability to create a non-root accounts, so that certain
    services that would normally run as root, perform initial configuration as
    root but then drop to a less privileged user.

    The test attempts to install a snap declaring to use a non-root user called
    "daemon". This name is not allowed so the installation fails and the user
    account is not created.

# List of expected snap install failures due to libseccomp/golang-seccomp being
# too old. Since the illegal name check happens after verifying system support,
# we can ignore these.
systems: [-amazon-linux-2-*, -centos-7-*, -ubuntu-14.04-*]
