summary: Check that try command works when daemon line is added to snap.yaml

systems: [-ubuntu-core-*]

environment:
  SERVICE: snap.test-snapd-service-try.service.service

    echo "When try is executed on that directory"

    # Sanity check just to ensure the test and its input yaml are correct
    echo "And it doesn't have a systemd service just yet"

    # so need to grep all the services
