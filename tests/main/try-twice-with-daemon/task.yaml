summary: Check that try command works when daemon line is added to snap.yaml
systems: [-ubuntu-core-16-64, -ubuntu-core-16-arm-64, -ubuntu-core-16-arm-32]

environment:
  SERVICE: snap.test-snapd-service-try.service.service

execute: |
  echo "Given a buildable snap in a known directory"
  echo "When try is executed on that directory"
  snap try $TESTSLIB/snaps/test-snapd-service-try-v1

  echo "Then the snap is listed as installed with try in the notes"
  snap list | grep -Pq "^test-snapd-service-try +.*?try"

  # Sanity check just to ensure the test and its input yaml are correct
  echo "And it doesn't have a systemd service just yet"
  # Note: systemctl in yakkety doesn't report LoadState=not-found for unknown services
  # so need to grep all the services
