summary: Check that try command works when daemon line is added to snap.yaml

details: |
    This test shows that a snap application can be converted from an app to a
    service between one revision of a snap installed with "snap try", and another.

systems: [-ubuntu-core-*]

environment:
  SERVICE: snap.test-snapd-service-try.service.service

execute: |
    echo "Given a buildable snap in a known directory"
    echo "When try is executed on that directory"
    snap try test-snapd-service-try-v1

    echo "Then the snap is listed as installed with try in the notes"
    snap list | MATCH "^test-snapd-service-try .* try"

    # Precondition check just to ensure the test and its input yaml are correct
    echo "And it doesn't have a systemd service just yet"
    # Note: systemctl in yakkety doesn't report LoadState=not-found for unknown services
    # so need to grep all the services
    if systemctl|grep -q "$SERVICE" ; then
        echo "Unexpected service $SERVICE"
        exit 1
    fi

    echo "When snap.yaml is updated with the daemon line added"
    echo "Then it can be tried again"
    snap try test-snapd-service-try-v2
    snap list | MATCH "^test-snapd-service-try .* try"
    echo "And a service is now loaded with systemd"

    expected_output="LoadState=loaded"
    output=$(systemctl show --property=LoadState "$SERVICE")
    if [ "$output" != "$expected_output" ]; then
        echo "Expected systemctl show output to be '$expected_output', but it was '$output'"
        exit 1
    fi
