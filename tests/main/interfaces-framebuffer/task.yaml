summary: Ensure that the framebuffer interface works.

details: |
    The framebuffer interface allows to access the /dev/fb* buffer files.

    The test uses the test-snapd-framebuffer snap to write/read from /dev/fb0.

    The test also checks the interface connection and disconnection works properly.
