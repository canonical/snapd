  Check that `snap install` doesn't leave a service running when the install fails.

details: |
  When installation fails for a snap which starts services, those services
  should not be left running.

  This attempts to install a snap with two services, one of which should run
  without trouble and the other of which is a notify service which returns
  false, and thus causes the installation to fail. The test then verifies that
  the trouble-free service is not left running after the install fails.

  echo "when a snap install fails"
  not "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-multi-service

  echo "we don't leave a service running"
  not systemctl is-active snap.test-snapd-multi-service.ok.service
