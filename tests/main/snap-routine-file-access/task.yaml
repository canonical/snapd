summary: The file-access command provides information about access to file paths

details: |
    The "snap routine file-access" command is intended to be a helper for
    xdg-document-portal. When xdg-document-portal is asked to make a file
    available to a snap, we would like to avoid proxying files that the snap can
    access directly.

    The command reports whether a particular file path represents the same file
    in both the host and sandbox mount namespaces, and whether it is readable or
    writable inside the snap sandbox. When used with the SaveFile portal API,
    it may be asked about file paths that don't yet exist.

    False negatives are not considered to be a problem: if file-access reports
    that a path is hidden, then it will just result in the document portal
    proxying a file that it didn't need to.

    The command may also report greater access than unix file permissions
    actually allow.  This is acceptable since there is nothing the document
    portal can do to increase the level of access.
