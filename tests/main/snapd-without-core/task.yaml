summary: Ensure the snapd works without core on classic systems

details: |
    Check that snapd can be installed without the core snap on classic
    systems and that commands can re-exec into snapd.

# Run only on ubuntu classic because this re-execs. We have a
# separate test for UC18 already and on UC16 we always have a core
# snap so we don't need to test there.
# Snapd snap is not available on i386 anymore. So we stick with 64 bits.
systems: [ubuntu-1*-64, ubuntu-2*-64]

environment:
    # uploading large snap triggers OOM
    SNAPD_NO_MEMORY_LIMIT: 1
