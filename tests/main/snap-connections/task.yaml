summary: Check that "snap connections" works as expected

details: |
    This test verifies that the output of "snap connections" shows the
    proper connections, as well a unconnected plugs and slots. Proper
    error messages are reported for ill-formed command lines. Plugs
    that are added or removed with a refresh should also be should
    also properly be updated in the output. The command line allows
    for selecting plugs and slots from a specific snap.
