summary: snaps installed with --jailmode are not in devmode
details: |
    Users found that a snap that uses "confinement: devmode", even when
    installed with "snap install --jailmode" is effectively in devmode (the
    apparmor profile is in complain mode) even if "snap list" reports it as
    "jailmode".
