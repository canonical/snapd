summary: Ensures that introspection of login1 of the shutdown interface works.

systems:
    # No confinement (AppArmor, Seccomp) available on these systems
    - -debian-*
    # unity7 implicit slot (used to access dbus-send), not available on core
    - -ubuntu-core-*

details: |
    A snap declaring the shutdown plug is defined, its command just calls
    the Introspect method on org.freedesktop.login1.

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring a plug on the shutdown interface is installed"
    snapbuild $TESTSLIB/snaps/shutdown-introspection-consumer .
    snap install --dangerous shutdown-introspection-consumer_1.0_all.snap

restore: |
    rm -f shutdown-introspection-consumer_1.0_all.snap

execute: |
    CONNECTED_PATTERN=":shutdown +shutdown-introspection-consumer"
    DISCONNECTED_PATTERN="(?s).*?\n- +shutdown-introspection-consumer:shutdown"

    echo "Then the plug is shown as disconnected"
    snap interfaces | MATCH "$DISCONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "==========================================="

    echo "When the plug is connected"
