summary: Ensure "dh_systemd_start --restart-after-upgrade" works

details: |
    dh_systemd_start is a debhelper program that is responsible for starting/stopping or restarting
    systemd unit files in case no corresponding sysv init script is available. The unit file is
    stopped before upgrades and started afterwards (unless --restart-after-upgrade is specified,
    in which case it will only be restarted after the upgrade)

    In this test it is simulated an upgrade from 2.48 to the current version. To achieve this the
    upgrade dpkg maintainer scripts have to be manually executed (preinst, postinst, prerm, and postrm)

    Finally it is verified that snapd is restarted when the upgrade is completed (just after postinst
    is executed), and it is not restarted during the process.

  # not on 16.04, dh_systemd_start --restart-after-upgrade is broken there
