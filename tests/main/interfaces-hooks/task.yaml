summary: Check that `snap connect` runs interface hooks

details: |
    Snapd hooks are programs that run in response to certain actions. The test
    exercises the full suite of hooks that correspond to interface connections.
    One important detail is that interface hooks can interact with plug and slot
    attributes, both static and dynamically created.
