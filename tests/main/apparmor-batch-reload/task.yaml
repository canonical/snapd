summary: Ensure that batch-reloading of AppArmor profiles works, including fallback.

details: |
    This test checks that apparmor profiles are re-generated on snapd startup in a batch,
    and that fallback logic of running apparmor parser for each individual snap takes
    over when the batch fails. This is tested by replacing /sbin/apparmor_parser with
    fake apparmor_parser.fake that fails when if multiple snaps are given (more than 10)
    at once, and otherwise succeeds and runs the real apparmor_parser.
    The test checks system log for transient errors reported by snapd for apparmor failures
    and then verifies apparmor cache to ensure expected profiles were created by fallback
    logic.
