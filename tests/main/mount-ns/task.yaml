summary: The shape of the mount namespace on classic systems for non-classic snaps

details: |
    This test measures the mount table of the host, of the mount namespace for
    a simple core16-based snap for the per-user mount namespace of a simple
    core16-base snap as well as for a simple core18 based snap and finally of a
    simple snap using classic confinement.

    The mount tables are obtained from /proc/pid/mountinfo interface. They are
    then fed to mountinfo.query with various determinism adjustment options and
    compared to stock tables created when the test was first made.

    Naturally occurring mount tables will differ from invocation to invocation
    for several reasons. Snap revisions seen in various paths will drift over
    time. The order of mount operations that can be done in parallel will
    differ from one boot to another. Good examples of that include
    /snap/name/revision, which can be all started in parallel. Another one is
    the set of control groups mounted in sysfs. Some mount options may be
    created based on the amount of available memory. Some mount entries may
    contain numeric IDs that are allocated and are hard to predict. Block
    devices backing actual file systems may be on various disks, for instance
    on /dev/vda or /dev/sdb. All of those are handled by mountinfo.query
    --rename and --renumber, along with sorting options that combat
    non-deterministic mount order.

    Unfortunately this test need separate data sets for google compute engine
    and for qemu. The images are just slightly different, containing small
    tweaks that result in different initial host mount table. Such changes are
    further reflected in per-snap and per-user mount namespaces, since they
    contain the view of the host namespace.

    Individual backend / system hierarchies can be compared using tools like
    meld or even diff. This test is very broad but which makes it somewhat
    fragile. It is likely to fail on any change affecting mounts performed by
    to snap-confine and snap-update-ns. This is by design. Mount propagation is
    somewhat complex and precise tests may not capture broad behavior changes.
    Of entire systems.

    Lastly, on core systems the test is somewhat artificial as it also measures
    changes performed by the test preparation process. Some of the mount
    entries are not present on real core systems.

    If you see this test randomly failing it may be because it has observed
    state leaked by another test that ran on the same machine earlier in the
    spread  execution chain.

# The test is sensitive to backend type, which designates the used image.
# Backends are enabled one-by-one along with the matching data set.

# Temporary, exclude on ubuntu-16.04-64 until mount ns changes on 16.04 are understood/fixed
systems: [ubuntu-18.04-64]
# The test itself works perfectly fine but in conjunction with our leaky test
# suite it often fails because it detects cruft left over by other tests in a
# way that was not detected before. Classic systems should be clear of mount
# side-effects now. The test should be _eventually_ enabled on
# ubuntu-core-16-64 and ubuntu-core-18-64.

# We have seen this test to fail when executed after another test that uses LXD
# (eg. tests/main/snap-snap). It is also documented in
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1949710 that LXD modifies the mounts in
# the host system thus making the state of the system different from what is
# expected and checked for in this test. Since we cannot really skip the test,
# cannot set a constraint that the test should not run on the same node as some
# other test, and we cannot fix LXD test to reboot in restore due to
# https://github.com/snapcore/spread/pull/85, we employ a workaround which is to
# bump the priority of this test such that is runs before any other tests that
# may use LXD.

    # Systemd creates an automount unit for the /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc filesystem.

    # behavior.  Since this is extremely easy to do, we don't want to affect
    # our measurement by it in any way. A simple way to avoid that is to stop

    # The --renumber and --rename options renumber and rename various
    # non-deterministic elements of the mount table. The --ref-x1000 option
    # sets a multiple of 1000 as the base value for allocated renumbered
    # identifiers, depending on the depth of "nesting" (via --ref) that is
    # used.  This makes it easier to maintain the tables in face of changes to
    # the host.

    # file-systems.  This way even if each element inside, say, /snap/... is

    # order is deterministic. The use of filesystem field is there so that
    # autofs mounted filesystems (like binfmt_misc) don't have random ordering
    # between the real thing and the automount entry.
