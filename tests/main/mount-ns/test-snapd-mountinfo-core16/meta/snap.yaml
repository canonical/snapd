# This layout is designed to create a writable mimic on top of production base
# snap, in this case core, without being extremely painful to analyze. The core
# snap contains the directory /usr/share/gdb/auto-load which will be re-created
# by the mimic at /usr/share/gdb. This allows us to have a test with just one
# re-created element and without engineering a custom core for this test.
