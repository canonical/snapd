summary: Check that IIO device nodes are accessible through an interface

details: |
    This test makes sure that a snap using the IIO interface can access
    devices nodes exposed by a slot properly.

    It modifies the core snap to provide a iio slot. The actual iio device
    node is served as a plain file with static text content. The test expects
    that, after a snap declared a iio plug is installed and connected, it can
    access the node and read/write its content.
