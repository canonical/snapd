summary: Test installing a component from the store

details: |
  Verifies that we can install a snap and components from the store at the same
  time.

systems: [ubuntu-16.04-64, ubuntu-18.04-64, ubuntu-2*, ubuntu-core-*, fedora-*]

restore: |
  snap remove test-snap-with-components || true

  # TODO:COMPS: remove this once removing a snap also removes components
  systemctl stop -- '*test*snap*with*components-components-mnt-*.mount' || true
  rm /etc/systemd/system/*'-test\x2dsnap\x2dwith\x2dcomponents-components-mnt-'*'.mount' || true
  rm -rf "$(os.paths snap-mount-dir)/test-snap-with-components"

execute: |
  snap install test-snap-with-components+one+two

  for comp in one two; do
      snap run test-snap-with-components ${comp}
  done

  # while this component is defined in the snap, it should not be installed
  not snap run test-snap-with-components three

  # TODO:COMPS: test variations of installing snap with components at specific
  # revisions once PR to enable installing with revision and channel is merged
