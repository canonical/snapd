summary: check that snap-update-ns can create mkdir in $SNAP_{DATA,COMMON}

details: |
    When snap-update-ns is invoked by snap-confine to construct a mount
    namespace it will create missing directories for the mount target.
    This will succeed in specific writable locations, such as $SNAP_DATA and
    $SNAP_COMMON. The $SNAP location is read only but thanks to overalyfs it
    too can be modified for the calling snap. The test is divided into variants
    for one of each $SNAP, $SNAP_DATA and $SNAP_COMMON. There's a slight
    variation for the $SNAP variable, see below for details.

environment:
    PLUG/data: test-snapd-content-advanced-plug:data
