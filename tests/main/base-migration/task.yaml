summary: A snap migrates from base "core" to "core18"

details: |
  Verify that a snap can be migrated from base:core to base:core18 and
  from base:core18 to base:core. Validate the base snaps are properly
  downloaded, the mount namespace information file is owned by root
  and the base version for the snap is updated accordingly.
