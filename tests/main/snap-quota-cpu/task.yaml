summary: Functional test for cpu quota-related snap commands.

details: |
  Functional test for snap cpu quota group commands ensuring that they are 
  effective in practice.

# these systems do not support quota groups due to their old systemd versions,
# and this is tested in the snap-quota spread test.
systems:
  - -ubuntu-14.04-*
  - -amazon-linux-2-*
  - -ubuntu-16.04-*
  - -ubuntu-core-16-*

restore: |
  echo "Stopping the service"
  snap stop test-snapd-stressd.stress-sc

execute: |
  echo "Starting service and verifying cpu usage"
  snap start test-snapd-stressd.stress-sc
