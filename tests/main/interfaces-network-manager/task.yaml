summary: Ensure that the network-manager interface works

details: |
    The network-manager interface gives privileged access to configure and
    observe networking.

    The test uses a snap which plugs the network manager interface. Then it is
    validated that the snap auto-connects and can create a new connection.
    Connection against network devices cannot be validated on a virtual machine
    due to network-manager being configured not to managed them.

# run only against the amd64 VM, we cannot run this on arm/arm64
# boards because the (wifi) network is already managed by netplan
# there and when n-m gets installed/removed it will hang when
# trying to deconfigure the wifi network which is already owned.
