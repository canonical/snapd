summary: Ensure that the posix-mq interface works

details: |
    The posix-mq interface allows access to the POSIX message queues. This test
    explores a number of features related to distinct sub-permissions implemented
    in snapd - read, write, create and delete.

systems:
    # no AppArmor, no mediation
    - -amazon-linux-*
    - -centos-9-64
    - -fedora-*
    # Too old to support this feature entirely.
    - -ubuntu-14.04-64
    - -debian-11-64
    # Distribution AppArmor parser does not support mqueue mediation.
    # AppArmor parser does not re-execute despite SNAPD_APPARMOR_REEXEC=1 in /usr/lib/snapd/info.
