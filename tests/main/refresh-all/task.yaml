summary: Check that more than one snap is refreshed.

systems: [-ubuntu-core-16-64]

details: |
    We use only the fake store for this test because we currently
    have only one controlled snap in the remote stores, when we will
    have more we can update the test to use them

environment:
    BLOB_DIR: $(pwd)/fake-store-blobdir

prepare: |
    . $TESTSLIB/store.sh

    echo "Given two snaps are installed"
    for snap in test-snapd-tools xkcd-webserver; do
        snap install $snap
    done

    echo "And the daemon is configured to point to the fake store"
    setup_store fake $BLOB_DIR

restore: |
    . $TESTSLIB/store.sh
    teardown_store fake $BLOB_DIR

execute: |
    echo "When the store is configured to make them refreshable"
    fakestore -make-refreshable test-snapd-tools,xkcd-webserver -dir $BLOB_DIR

    echo "And a refresh is performed"
    snap refresh

    echo "Then the new versions are installed"
    for snap in test-snapd-tools xkcd-webserver; do
        snap list | grep -Pq "$snap.*?fake1"
    done
