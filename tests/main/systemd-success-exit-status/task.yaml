summary: Check that services with success-exit-status have SuccessExitStatus directive

details: |
    Verifies that a snap service with SuccessExitStatus=42 250 is considered active or successfully terminated by systemd when it exits with status 42 or 250, and that other unexpected signals do not have this effect.

environment:
    SERVICE_NAME: snap.test-snapd-success-exit-status.test-snapd-success-exit-status.service

restore: |
    snap remove --purge test-snapd-success-exit-status || true

execute: |
