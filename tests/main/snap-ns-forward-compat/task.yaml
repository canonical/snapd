summary: Test that snap-confine errors in the right way

details: |
    Check that snap-confine and snap-update-ns are compatible with a filesystem
    based on a tmpfs, as part of the work to support homedirs in arbitrary
    locations.

# Skip 32-bit architectures because the core20 snap is not available there
# Skip debian-sid as pivot_root binary is not anymore within util-linux
systems: [-*-32, -debian-sid-*]

skip:
    - reason: Unshare command doesn't support saving the namespace
