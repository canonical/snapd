summary: Test that snapd reexecs itself into the snapd snap

details: |
    This test ensures that snap cli reexecs itself into the snapd snap under the
    right conditions (when SNAP_REEXEC is set and when experimental.snapd-snap=true)

    We also check that the snapd snap is automatically installed when the
    experimental.snapd-snap feature is enabled.

# Disable for Fedora, openSUSE and Arch as re-exec is not support there yet
systems: [-ubuntu-core-*, -fedora-*, -opensuse-*, -arch-*, -amazon-*, -centos-*]

    # the local snap and "tweak" the core snap to get re-exec but this will
    # only work with core re-exec not snapd-reexec.
