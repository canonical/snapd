summary: Ensure that we accounted for all syscalls known to libseccomp

description: |
  The snap-seccomp tool maintains a list of all syscalls supported by
  libseccomp. The test ensures that we catch when the internal list is not in
  sync with upstream anymore, and thus an update is needed. See
  https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/spread-test-failing-due-to-new-syscalls/12018 for
  more details.
