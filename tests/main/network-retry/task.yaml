summary: Ensure network retry works correctly

details: |
    Snapd has certain capability to retry failed network operations, as network
    in never perfectly reliable. The test creates an environment where the DNS
    system is broken, attempts to install a snap from the store, fixes the DNS
    environment and ensures that the snap is installed correctly.

environment:
    # on core systems, the test was seen to misbehave when memory limit is set
    SNAPD_NO_MEMORY_LIMIT: 1
