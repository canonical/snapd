summary: Ensure that the gpio physical memory control interface works.

details: |
    The gpio-memory-control interface allows read/write access to all gpio memory.

systems: [ubuntu-core-16-arm-*]

environment:
    CONNECTED_PATTERN: ':gpio-memory-control +test-snapd-gpio-memory-control'
    DISCONNECTED_PATTERN: '\- +test-snapd-gpio-memory-control:gpio-memory-control'

prepare: |
    echo "Given the test-snapd-gpio-memory-control snap is installed"

restore: |
    rm -f call.error
