summary: Ensure that the gpio physical memory control interface works.

details: |
    The gpio-memory-control interface allows read/write access to all gpio memory.

systems: [ubuntu-core-16-arm-*]

prepare: |
    echo "Given the test-snapd-gpio-memory-control snap is installed"
    snap install test-snapd-gpio-memory-control

restore: |
    rm -f call.error

execute: |

        echo "The /dev/gpiomem device does not exist in current system"
        exit 0

    echo "When the interface is connected"
    snap connect test-snapd-gpio-memory-control:gpio-memory-control

    echo "Then the snap is able read and write the physical memory"
