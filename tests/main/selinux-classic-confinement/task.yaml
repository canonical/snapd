summary: Ensure that classic snap with hooks and services works with SELinux

details: |
    On systems where SELinux is supported, make sure that classic snaps work
    should the user enable support. Focus on snaps with services and hooks as
    those are run under targeted policy.

systems:
    - fedora-*
    - centos-*
    - opensuse-*-selinux-*

environment:
    CLASSIC_SNAP: test-snapd-classic-service-hooks

prepare: |
    snap pack "$CLASSIC_SNAP"

    # although classic snaps do not work out of the box on Fedora and CentOS we
    # still want to verify if the basics do work if the user symlinks /snap to
    # $SNAP_MOUNT_DIR themselves
    SNAP_MOUNT_DIR="$(os.paths snap-mount-dir)"
    if [ "$SNAP_MOUNT_DIR" != "/snap" ]; then
        ln -sf "$SNAP_MOUNT_DIR" /snap
        tests.cleanup defer rm -f /snap
    fi

    getenforce > enforcing.mode

    # Enable enforcing mode, our policy is already marked as permissive, so we
    # will get audit entries but the program will not be stopped by SELinux
    setenforce 1
    ausearch --checkpoint stamp -m AVC || true

restore: |
    setenforce "$(cat enforcing.mode)"

execute: |
    snap install --dangerous --classic "${CLASSIC_SNAP}_1.0_all.snap"

    ausearch -i --checkpoint stamp --start checkpoint -m AVC 2>&1 | MATCH 'no matches'

    MATCH 'install hook' < "/var/snap/$CLASSIC_SNAP/common/log"
    MATCH 'configure hook' < "/var/snap/$CLASSIC_SNAP/common/log"

    systemctl is-active "snap.$CLASSIC_SNAP.service.service"

    snap remove "$CLASSIC_SNAP"
