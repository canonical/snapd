summary: Ensure that classic snap with hooks and services works with SELinux

description: |
    On systems where SELinux is supported, make sure that classic snaps work
    should the user enable support. Focus on snaps with services and hooks as
    those are run under targeted policy.

environment:
    CLASSIC_SNAP: test-snapd-classic-service-hooks

systems: [fedora-*, centos-*]

prepare: |
    #shellcheck source=tests/lib/snaps.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB"/snaps.sh
    #shellcheck source=tests/lib/dirs.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB"/dirs.sh
    snap pack "$TESTSLIB/snaps/$CLASSIC_SNAP/"

    # although classic snaps do not work out of the box on Fedora and CentOS we
    # still want to verify if the basics do work if the user symlinks /snap to
    # $SNAP_MOUNT_DIR themselves
    ln -sf $SNAP_MOUNT_DIR /snap

    getenforce > enforcing.mode

    # Enable enforcing mode, our policy is already marked as permissive, so we
    # will get audit entries but the program will not be stopped by SELinux
    setenforce 1
    ausearch --checkpoint stamp -m AVC || true

restore: |
    rm -f /snap
    setenforce "$(cat enforcing.mode)"

execute: |
    snap install --dangerous --classic "${CLASSIC_SNAP}_1.0_all.snap"

    ausearch -i --checkpoint stamp --start checkpoint -m AVC 2>&1 | MATCH 'no matches'

    MATCH 'install hook' < "/var/snap/$CLASSIC_SNAP/common/log"
    MATCH 'configure hook' < "/var/snap/$CLASSIC_SNAP/common/log"

    systemctl is-active "snap.$CLASSIC_SNAP.service.service"

    snap remove "$CLASSIC_SNAP"
