summary: Ensure that snap layouts are applied
details: |
    This test installs a test snap that uses layout declarations.
    The layout changes which directories and files exist in the filesystem
    in the area beyond the $SNAP directory. In addition all applications and
    hooks get permissions to access those areas.
