summary: Check that symlinks to /usr/bin/snap trigger `snap run`

details: |
    While snap applications are mounted, executing programs directly is not
    desirable since this way bypasses both the security sandbox and the extra
    elements that allow applications to work correctly, finding the right
    libraries and data.

    To allow users to start applications, snapd maintains a system of symbolic
    links from all entry points (all snap commands and aliases), to the "snap"
    program. When invoked the snap program determines which snap name, instance
    key and application to invoke.

    Historically such files were not symbolic links but dedicated wrappers. The
    test shows that one can replace the wrapper with the symbolic link. This
    test is probably not useful anymore and could be removed. Snapd has not been
    generating "wrappers" for many years.
