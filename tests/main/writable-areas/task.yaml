summary: Check that snap apps and services can write to writable areas.

details: |
    The confinement system allows snap applications to write to four locations:
    snap data specific to the current revision, snap data common across
    revisions, snap user data specific to the current revision and lastly snap
    user data common across revisions.

environment:
    # Ensure that running purely from the deb (without re-exec) works
    # correctly
    SNAP_REEXEC/reexec0: 0
    SNAP_REEXEC/reexec1: 1

prepare: |
    snap pack data-writer

execute: |
    snap install --dangerous data-writer_1.0_all.snap
