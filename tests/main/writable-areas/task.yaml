summary: Check that snap apps and services can write to writable areas.

details: |
    The confinement system allows snap applications to write to four locations:
    snap data specific to the current revision, snap data common across
    revisions, snap user data specific to the current revision and lastly snap
    user data common across revisions.

environment:
    # Ensure that running purely from the deb (without re-exec) works
    # correctly
    SNAP_REEXEC/reexec0: 0
    SNAP_REEXEC/reexec1: 1

prepare: |
    snap pack data-writer
    SNAP_MOUNT_DIR="$(os.paths snap-mount-dir)"
    if [ "$SNAP_REEXEC" = "1" ] && [ "$SNAP_MOUNT_DIR" != "/snap" ] && [ ! -L /snap ]; then
        # reexec expects to find the snapd snap under /snap, enable it to do so
        # on distros using /var/lib/snapd/snap
        ln -sf "$SNAP_MOUNT_DIR" /snap
        tests.cleanup defer rm -f /snap
