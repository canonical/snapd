summary: Ensure that certain directories are coming from the core snap
details: |
  The snap-confine program bind mounts the /etc directory from the
  classic distribution into the snap execution environment.
  Certain directories however, if they exist on the host's /etc
  are actually, bind-mounted from the core snap for a more
  consistent behaviour across various distributions.
