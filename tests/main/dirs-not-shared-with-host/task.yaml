summary: Ensure that certain directories are coming from the core snap

details: |
  The snap-confine program bind mounts the /etc directory from the
  classic distribution into the snap execution environment.
  Certain directories however, if they exist on the host's /etc
  are actually, bind-mounted from the core snap for a more
  consistent behaviour across various distributions.

environment:
    DIRECTORY/apparmord: /etc/apparmor.d

# This test only applies to classic systems
# fedora, centos, amazon: do not have /etc/apparmor.d
systems: [-ubuntu-core-*, -fedora-*, -centos-*, -amazon-linux-*]
