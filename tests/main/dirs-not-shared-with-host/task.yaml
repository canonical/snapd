summary: Ensure that certain directories are coming from the core snap
details: |
  The snap-confine program bind mounts the /etc directory from the
  classic distribution into the snap execution environment.
  Certain directories however, if they exist on the host's /etc
  are actually, bind-mounted from the core snap for a more
  consistent behaviour across various distributions.
systems:
    # This test only applies to classic systems
    - -ubuntu-core-16-*
    # Disabled for Fedora and openSUSE until test case is properly ported
    - -fedora-*
    - -opensuse-*
