summary: Check that try command works when snap dir is omitted

details: |
    The snap try command can be executed without an argument, to imply that the
    current working directory is the root of the unpacked snap structure. The
    test uses "snap try" to install one of the test packages and ensures that it
    shows up as in "try" mode according to "snap list"

systems: [-ubuntu-core-*]

execute: |
    echo "When try is executed inside a snap directory"
    # shellcheck disable=SC2164
    cd "$TESTSLIB"/snaps/test-snapd-tools
    snap try

    echo "Then the snap is listed as installed with try in the notes"
    snap list | grep -Pq '^test-snapd-tools +.*?try'
