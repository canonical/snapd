summary: Ensure that the snapd-control "refresh-schedule" attribute works.

# FIXME: core18 right now does not have a canonical model. This means that it
# will not get a serial. We have code in devicestate.go that will only try to
# auto-refresh after the systems has tried at least 3 times to get a serial.
# But this means this test will timeout because the first retry for the serial
# happens after 5min, then 10min, then 20min.
