summary: Ensure that the snapd-control "refresh-schedule" attribute works.

details: |
    The snapd-control interface offers a way for a connected snap to manage
    refreshes of all the snaps on the system. The test prepares an environment
    in which a snap is given this permission, by signing a specifically crafted
    snap declaration assertion, ensures that no snap can manage refreshes,
    installs the snap and the assertion and ensures that snapd now recognizes
    the new permission. The test then continues to exercise the permission in
    practice, by setting refresh schedule to the special "managed" value. The
    test explores what happens when the plug carrying the permission is
    disconnected.

    While in managed mode, snapd does not refresh snaps automatically anymore,
    relinquishing complete control to a management agent carrying the
    permission.
