summary: Ensure that the firewall-control interface works.

details: |
    The firewall-control interface allows a snap to configure the firewall.

    A snap which defines the firewall-control plug must be shown in the
    interfaces list. The plug must not be auto-connected on install and, as
    usual, must be able to be reconnected.

    For this test we use a snap that declares a plug on this interface and that
    adds and removes iptables entries. With the plug connected the test checks
    that a rule to map localhost to a given IP can be added by the snap,
    ensuring that a generic client can access a generic service listening on
    localhost through the IP set up in the firewall rule.
