summary: Ensure that the firewall-control interface works.

details: |
    The firewall-control interface allows a snap to configure the firewall.

    A snap which defines the firewall-control plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    For this test we use a snap that declares a plug on this interface and that adds and
    removes iptables entries. With the plug connected the test checks that a rule to map
    localhost to a given IP can be added by the snap, ensuring that a generic client can
    access a generic service listening on localhost through the IP set up in the firewall
    rule.
