summary: Check that snaps vanishing are handled gracefully

details: |
    The snap try command can be used to install a snap without creating the
    squashfs file, which for large snaps is very costly. The test shows that
    even if the directory holding try-mode snap's files is removed, snapd does
    not malfunction and allows the snap to be removed correctly.

    Note that this test is subtly different from tests/regression/lp-1764977.
    See the description of that test for details.

environment:
    SNAP_NAME/test_snapd_tools: test-snapd-tools
    SNAP_NAME/test_snapd_service: test-snapd-service

    rm -rf "$TRYDIR"

execute: |
    mkdir -p "$TRYDIR"
    # make sure the dir has correct permissions in case the default umask is
    # different

    echo Trying a snap
    snap try "$TRYDIR"

    echo Removing a snap try dir does not break everything
    rm -rf "$TRYDIR"

    echo A snap in broken state can be removed
    snap remove --purge "$SNAP_NAME"

    echo And is gone afterwards
