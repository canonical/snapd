summary: Ensure that /dev/input/event* is denied by default.

details: |
    The default policy disallows access to /dev/input/event*.

    The joystick interface disallows access to /dev/input/event* for
    non-joysticks.

    The test checks the snap is not able to access /dev/input/event* with or
    without the joystick interface connected. We do this since the
    /dev/input/event* devices are sensitive and because the joystick interface
    adds a /dev/input/event* AppArmor glob rule that relies entirely on the
    device cgroup for enforcement.
