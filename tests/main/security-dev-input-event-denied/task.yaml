summary: Ensure that /dev/input/event* is denied by default.

details: |
    The default policy disallows access to /dev/input/event*.

    The joystick interface disallows access to /dev/input/event* for
    non-joysticks.

    The device-buttons interface disallows access to /dev/input/event* for
    non-device-keys.

    The test checks the snap is not able to access /dev/input/event* with or
    without the joystick or device-buttons interface(s) connected. We do this
    since the /dev/input/event* devices are sensitive and because these
    interfaces add a /dev/input/event* AppArmor glob rule that relies entirely
    on the device cgroup for enforcement.
