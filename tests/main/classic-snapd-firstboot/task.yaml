summary: Check that firstboot assertions are imported and snaps installed also on classic

details: |
    Verify that the snapd.seeded.service unit is able to import assertions from
    the seed directory and install the seed snaps on classic systems. This test
    specifically makes sure that the classic system can install snapd as a snap
    from the seed.
