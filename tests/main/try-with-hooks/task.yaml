prepare: |
  cp -a "$TESTSLIB"/snaps/basic ./
  # in case the snap is modified to have the hook
  rm -f basic/meta/hooks/pre-refresh

execute: |
    echo "Snap try a snap without pre-refresh hook"
    snap try basic

    echo "Snap try again"
    snap try basic

    echo "Remove the snap and snap try again"
    snap remove --purge basic

    mkdir -p basic/meta/hooks
    echo "#!/bin/sh" > basic/meta/hooks/pre-refresh
    chmod +x basic/meta/hooks/pre-refresh

    # TODO: This should not fail, but it does. Update the test once the issue of second snap try with a new hook is fixed.
    echo "Expecting snap try to fail"

        echo "Expected snap try with a new hook to fail"
