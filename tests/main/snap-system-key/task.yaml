summary: Ensure security profile re-generation works with system-key

details: |
    Check that security profile are re-generated when a system-key
    version mismatch is detected. Also check that `snap run` waits
    for system-key updates unless when it can talk to snapd.

    cp /tmp/fstab.save /etc/fstab
    rm -f /tmp/fstab.save
    # Systemd detects changes to fstab and complains that the -.mount unit has
    # changed on disk.
