summary: measuring basic properties of device cgroup v2

details: |
    Verify some basic properties of the device cgroups v2. Some checks are:
    The device cgroup of the main process is the expected one.
    The initial constraints imposed by the device cgroup made by systemd.
    After a connection is done, the device cgroup is updated accordingly.
    The main process for a snap is in the snapd-made cgroup after a command
    is executed via snap-confine.
