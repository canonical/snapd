summary: Check cold-plug system-user autoimport

details: |
    After the ubuntu-core is prepared we end with a system-user
    assertion ready to be autoimported in a block device. This
    test checks that the creation took place after the first boot.

execute: |
    if [ "$TRUST_TEST_KEYS" = "false" ]; then
        echo "This test needs test keys to be trusted"
        exit
    fi

    echo "Ensure there are ssh keys imported"
    grep ssh-rsa /home/user1/.ssh/authorized_keys

    echo "Ensure the user is a sudo user"
    sudo -u user1 sudo true
