summary: Check that the refresh command uses deltas

# delta downloads are currently disabled by default on core
systems: [-ubuntu-core-*]

environment:
    SNAP_NAME: test-snapd-delta-refresh
    SNAP_VERSION_PATTERN: \d+\.\d+\+fake1

prepare: |
    # The store currently only calculates deltas in the same channel,
    # so we need to setup the test first with two edge uploads, then
    # set on of the edge snaps to beta. This was done with r3 -> r5.
    #
    # We have edge as r3, beta as r5 and the store has a delta for
    # r3 -> r5b
