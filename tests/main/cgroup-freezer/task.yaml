summary: Each snap process is moved to appropriate freezer cgroup
# fedora-32: uses cgroupv2, which does not support a separate freezer controller
# fedora-33: uses cgroupv2, which does not support a separate freezer controller
# debian-sid: uses cgroupv2, which does not support a separate freezer controller
systems: [ -fedora-32-*, -fedora-33-*, -debian-sid-*]

    This test creates a snap process that suspends itself and ensures that it
    placed into the appropriate hierarchy under the freezer cgroup.
