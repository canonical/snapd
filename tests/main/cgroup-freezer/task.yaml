summary: Each snap process is moved to appropriate freezer cgroup

details: |
    This test creates a snap process that suspends itself and ensures that it
    placed into the appropriate hierarchy under the freezer cgroup.

# Disable the test on all systems that boot with cgroup v2
systems: [ -fedora-*, -debian-*, -arch-*, -opensuse-tumbleweed-*, -ubuntu-22.*, -ubuntu-23.*, -ubuntu-24.*, -ubuntu-core-22-*, -centos-9-*, -amazon-linux-2023-*]
