summary: ensure that the x11 interface shares UNIX domain sockets

details: |
    In addition to the abstract "@/tmp/.X11-unix/X?" socket an X
    server listens on, it also listens on a regular UNIX domain socket
    in /tmp/.X11-unix.

    The x11 plug will bind mount the socket directory from the slot
    providing it: either the host system's /tmp for the implicit
    system:x11 slot, or an application snap's private /tmp if it is a
    regular slot.

restore: |
    rm -f /tmp/.X11-unix/X0
