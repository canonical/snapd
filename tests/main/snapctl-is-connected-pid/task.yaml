summary: Ensure "snapctl is-connected" --pid and --apparmor-label options work.

details: |
    This test uses the "snapctl is-connected" command to verify that the "--pid"
    and "--apparmor-label" options work as expected.

    The "--pid" option is tested by connecting a plug and slot and verifying
    that the slot is connected to the process ID of the service running in the
    snap.

    The "--apparmor-label" option is tested by verifying that the slot is
    connected to the AppArmor label of the service running in the snap.
