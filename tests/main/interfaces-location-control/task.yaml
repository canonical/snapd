summary: Ensure that the location-control interface works.

details: |
    The location-control interface allows a snap to operate as the location service.

    A snap which defines the location-control plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.
    The snap is also declaring a plug on this interface must be able to ask for its properties.
