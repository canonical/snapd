summary: Ensure that the location-control interface works.

details: |
    The location-control interface allows a snap to operate as the location service.

    A snap which defines the location-control plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.
    The snap is also declaring a plug on this interface must be able to ask for its properties.

# s390x does not support locationd
systems:
    - -amazon-linux-2-* # no session services
    - -ubuntu-*-s390x # no support for locationd
    - -ubuntu-14.04-* # no tests.session support
    - -ubuntu-core-* # no session services (except for core20+)

    echo "And the provider dbus loop is started"
    # XXX: The provider is not a service so we have to start it manually.  It
    # attaches to the system bus so it just goes into a systemd service and not
    # via tests.session.

    # provider.py was started from a snap by the test-snapd-location-control-provider.service unit,
    # normally it should be enough to kill the whole unit, however since that process
    # was started from a snap, it got moved to a separate snap-specific transient
    # scope, thus it is no longer part of the unit's cgroup
