summary: Ensure that the location-control interface works.

details: |
    The location-control interface allows a snap to operate as the location
    service.

    A snap which defines the location-control plug must be shown in the
    interfaces list. The plug must not be auto-connected on install and, as
    usual, must be able to be reconnected.

    The snap is also declaring a plug on this interface must be able to ask for
    its properties.

# s390x does not support locationd
systems:
    - -amazon-linux-2-* # no session services
    - -ubuntu-*-s390x # no support for locationd
    - -ubuntu-14.04-* # no tests.session support
    - -ubuntu-core-* # no session services (except for core20+)

    echo "And the provider dbus loop is started"
    # XXX: The provider is not a service so we have to start it manually.  It
    # attaches to the system bus so it just goes into a systemd service and not
    # via tests.session.

    # was started from a snap, it got moved to a separate snap-specific transient
