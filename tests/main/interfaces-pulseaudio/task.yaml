summary: Ensure that the pulseaudio interface works

details: |
    Historically snapd offered the pulseaudio interface which allowed both
    playback and recording capabilities.

    The test exercises that both audio playback and recording are really governed
    by the interface connection.

# Only classic Ubuntu has the pulseaudio mediation patches. Ubuntu 14.04 is unsupported on the desktop.
# TODO: extend tests.session and run this test on 14.04 as well.
systems: [ubuntu-16.04-*, ubuntu-18.04-*, ubuntu-2*]
