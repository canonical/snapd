summary: Ensure that the libvirt interface works.

systems: [ubuntu-16.04-64]

details: |
    The libvirt interface allows a snap to access the libvirtd socket in order to manage
    libvirt domains and other resources.

    A snap which defines a libvirt plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to create and destroy a domain.
    The test uses a snap that carries a unikernel built to be run on top of qemu, boot and
    respond to ping. Once the domain is created, the test checks connectivity to the unikernel.

prepare: |
    # Given test user is added to the libvirtd group
    adduser test libvirtd

    echo "And libvirt is configured to manage /dev/net/tun"
    systemctl stop libvirtd.service || true
    echo 'cgroup_device_acl = ["/dev/net/tun", "/dev/random", "/dev/urandom"]' | tee -a /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf

    echo "And the required services up"
    systemctl start libvirtd.service
    systemctl start virtlogd.socket

    echo "And a snap declaring a plug on the libvirt interface is installed"
    snap install --edge test-snapd-libvirt-consumer

    echo "And the required tap interface is in place"
    ip tuntap add tap100 mode tap
    ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev tap100
    ip link set dev tap100 up

restore: |
    ip link delete tap100

    # remove test user from the libvirtd group
    deluser test libvirtd

execute: |
    echo "The interface is not connected by default"
    snap interfaces -i libvirt | MATCH '^- +test-snapd-libvirt-consumer:libvirt'
