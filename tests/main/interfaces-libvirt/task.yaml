summary: Ensure that the libvirt interface works.

details: |
    The libvirt interface allows a snap to access the libvirtd socket in order
    to manage libvirt domains and other resources.

    A snap which defines a libvirt plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be auto-connected on install and, as usual, must be able
    to be reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to create and destroy
    a domain. The test uses a snap that carries a unikernel built to be run on
    top of qemu, boot and respond to ping. Once the domain is created, the test
    checks connectivity to the unikernel.
