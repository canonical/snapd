summary: Ensure that the content sharing interface works.

# This test purges the state which causes the device to reinitialize
# with (potentially) a different core snap. Running this on core will
# also trigger a reboot in the middle of the tests because the new
# core will be applied. So skip the test on core devices.

    The content-sharing interface interface allows a snap to access contents from
    other snap

    A snap which defines the content sharing plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.
