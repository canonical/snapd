summary: Ensure that the content sharing interface works.

details: |
    The content-sharing interface interface allows a snap to access contents from
    other snap

    A snap which defines the content sharing plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    echo "Given a snap declaring a content sharing slot is installed"
    snap install --edge test-snapd-content-slot

    echo "And a snap declaring a content sharing plug is installed"
