summary: Ensure that the content sharing interface works.

details: |
    The content-sharing interface interface allows a snap to access contents from
    other snap

    A snap which defines the content sharing plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

backends: [-autopkgtest]

# This test purges the state which causes the device to reinitialize
# with (potentially) a different core snap. Running this on core will
# also trigger a reboot in the middle of the tests because the new
# core will be applied. So skip the test on core devices.
