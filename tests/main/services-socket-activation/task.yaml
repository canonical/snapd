summary: Basic verification of socket-activated services.

details: |
    This installs a snap which define sockets for systemd socket activation, and verifies
    that basic start/stop works as intended for services that have socket activation.

prepare: |
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local socket-activation

restore: |
    systemctl daemon-reload

execute: |
    [ -f /etc/systemd/system/snap.socket-activation.sleep-daemon.sock.socket ]
    [ -S /var/snap/socket-activation/common/socket ]
