summary: Each snap app and hook is tracked via cgroups

details: |
    This test creates a snap process that suspends itself and ensures that it
    placed into the appropriate hierarchy.

systems:
    # Ubuntu 14.04's special version of systemd doesn't have StartTransientUnit API.
    # This is covered in more depth in the sister cgroup-tracking-failure test.
    - -ubuntu-14.04-*
