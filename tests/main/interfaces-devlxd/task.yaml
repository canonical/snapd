summary: Ensure devlxd interface works.

details: |
    The devlxd interface allows a snap to access the LXD devlxd socket.
    This socket provides instance information and metadata to applications
    running inside LXD instances.

systems: [ubuntu-*]

environment:
    DEVLXD_PATH: /dev/lxd/sock

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring a devlxd plug is installed"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-sh

    echo "And the devlxd socket directory exists"
    p=/dev/lxd/sock
    if [ -e "$p" ]; then
        echo "Socket path $p already exists"
        exit 1
    fi

    mkdir -p "$(dirname "$p")"
    echo "LXD response" > "$p"

restore: |
    rm -rf /var/snap/lxd/common/lxd/devlxd /dev/lxd

execute: |
    echo "The interface is not connected by default"
    snap interfaces -i devlxd | MATCH '^- +test-snapd-sh:devlxd'

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect test-snapd-sh:devlxd

    echo "Then the snap is able to access the socket path"
    # We don't have anything to connect to the UNIX socket so we
    # only verify that we can open() it by using cat
    test-snapd-sh.with-devlxd-plug -c "cat $DEVLXD_PATH" |& tee output.log || true
    MATCH "LXD response" < output.log

    if [ "$(snap debug confinement)" = partial ] ; then
        exit 0
    fi

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect test-snapd-sh:devlxd

    echo "Then the snap cannot access the socket path"
