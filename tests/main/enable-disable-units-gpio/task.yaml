summary: Check that systemd units are enabled/disabled and gpio works after rebooting

details: |
    This test makes sure that the systemd snippet created by the gpio interface
    is executed after a reboot.

    It modifies the core snap to provide a gpio slot. Also, a mocked gpio node and the
    required systemfs files (export and unexeport) are created as a bind mount. The test
    expects that, after a snap declared a gpio plug is installed and connected, after
    a reboot the systemd service tries to regenerate the gpio device node if it does not
    find it.
