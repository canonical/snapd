summary: Check that snaps with configure work on core18 only

details: |
    Verify that we can run snaps with configure hooks while only having the
    "core18" base snap present. This test stems from reports that configure hooks
    were only working on systems that had the "core" snap installed.

systems: [-ubuntu-core-*]

prepare: |
    echo "Ensure empty state"
    echo "Ensure all snaps are gone"
    snapd.tool exec snap-mgmt --purge

    tests.systemd stop-unit snapd.service
    rm -f /var/lib/snapd/state.json
    systemctl start snapd
    snap wait system seed.loaded

execute: |
    echo "Install test snap"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-with-configure-core18

    snap list core18
    if snap list core; then
        echo "core got installed but shouldn't. test broken"
        exit 1
