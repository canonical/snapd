summary: Ensure that the wayland interface works

details: |
    The wayland interface (in snapd) grants permission either operate as a
    service implementing the wayland protocol, or as a client which connects to
    such a service.

    The test installs a snap from the store, which is then used to connect to a
    headless weston process, and ensure that it can see the wl_compositor
    object.

# Only test on classic Ubuntu amd64 systems that have wayland
# TODO: Expand this to Fedora and other systems.
# TODO: Enable for ubuntu 23+, currently it fails to start the headless-weston.service
systems:
    - ubuntu-16.04-64
    - ubuntu-18.04-64
    - ubuntu-20.04-64
    - ubuntu-22.04-64
