  Ensure `snap validate --monitor` works with validation-sets from the store.

details: |
  A validation set is an assertion that lists specific snaps that are either
  required to be installed together or are permitted to be installed together
  on a device or system.

  A validation set can either be in monitoring mode, in which case its constraints
  aren't enforced, or in enforcing mode, in which case snapd will not allow
  operations which would result in snaps breaking the validation set's constraints.

  This test verifies that having a validation set configured in the store and
  (set in monitor mode), it can be monitored by using the `snap validate --monitor`
  command. It is verified that `snap validate` command properly shows invalid and
  valid status depending if the snap required are installed.

# This test uses validation set assertions from the store uploaded upfront
# with my (stolowski) private store key (account-id: xSfWKGdLoQBoQx88vIM1MpbFNMq53t1f,
# public-key-sha3: o_x83A3wpIvJznIHBJIK7jRmRZKLlqx5jOr30HUsloFfBseXNF0ztoj18EvNualy);
# the input assertion provided with the test is testset1-seq1.yaml and testset1-seq2.yaml;
# they are included for reference and in case this needs to be recreated with another
# developer account, but otherwise are not used in the test.
#
# If this needs to be redone with another developer account, the steps are:
# 1. update account-id in the testset1-*.yaml files for the developer to use.
# 2. upload validation-set assertions to the store (repeat for sequence 1 and sequence 2,
#    paste respective testseq1-seqN.yaml file when snapcraft opens up the editor):
#    snapcraft edit-validation-sets <account-id> testset1 1
#    snapcraft edit-validation-sets <account-id> testset1 2
# 3. change account-ids in the test with the desired developer key.
