summary: Ensure that the locale-control interface works.

details: |
    The locale-control interface allows a snap to access the locale
    configuration.

    A snap which defines the locale-control plug must be shown in the interfaces
    list. The plug must not be auto-connected on install and, as usual, must be
    able to be reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to access the
    /etc/default/locale file both for reading and writing. This path doesn't
    exist on the excluded distributions.
