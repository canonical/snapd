summary: Ensure that the locale-control interface works.

details: |
    The locale-control interface allows a snap to access the locale configuration.

    A snap which defines the locale-control plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to access the /etc/default/locale
    file both for reading and writing. This path doesn't exist on the excluded distributions.

systems: [-fedora-*, -opensuse-*, -arch-*, -amazon-*, -centos-*]
