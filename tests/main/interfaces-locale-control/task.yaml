summary: Ensure that the locale-control interface works.

summary: |
    The locale-control interface allows a snap to access the locale configuration.

    A snap which defines the locale-control plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to access the /etc/default/locale
    file.

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring a plug on the locale-control interface is installed"
    snapbuild $TESTSLIB/snaps/locale-control-consumer .
    snap install locale-control-consumer_1.0_all.snap

execute: |
    CONNECTED_PATTERN=":locale-control +locale-control-consumer"
    DISCONNECTED_PATTERN="(?s).*?\n- +locale-control-consumer:locale-control"

    echo "Then it is not connected by default"
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$DISCONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "==================================="

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect locale-control-consumer:locale-control ubuntu-core:locale-control

    echo "Then the snap is able to read the locale configuration"
    [ $(sudo -i -u test /bin/sh -c "locale-control-consumer.get LANG") = "$LANG" ]

    echo "==================================="

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect locale-control-consumer:locale-control ubuntu-core:locale-control

    echo "Then the snap is not able to read the locale configuration"
    if sudo -i -u test /bin/sh -c "locale-control-consumer.get LANG"; then
        echo "Expected permission error accessing locale configuration with disconnected plug"
        exit 1
    fi
