summary: the /snap directory has a magic README file

details: |
    We found that some users are genuinely confused and concerned about the
    /snap directory or the disk space it appears to be using. Snapd now
    maintains a README file with some useful hints about what is going on that
    will, hopefully, help people understand this better.

    snap version # To ensure that snapd is awake
