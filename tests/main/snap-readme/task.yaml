summary: the /snap directory has a magic README file

details: |
    We found that some users are genuinely confused and concerned about the
    /snap directory or the disk space it appears to be using. Snapd now
    maintains a README file with some useful hints about what is going on that
    will, hopefully, help people understand this better.

execute: |
    snap version # To ensure that snapd is awake
    #shellcheck source=tests/lib/dirs.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB"/dirs.sh
    MATCH "https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/the-snap-directory/2817" "$SNAP_MOUNT_DIR/README"
