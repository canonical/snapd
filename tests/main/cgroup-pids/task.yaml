summary: Each snap app and hook is tracked in a pids cgroup
# fedora-31: uses cgroupv2, which does not have a separate pids controller hierarchy
systems: [ -fedora-31-*]

details: |
    This test creates a snap process that suspends itself and ensures that it
    placed into the appropriate hierarchy under the pids cgroup.

prepare: |
    # This feature depends on the release-app-awareness feature
    snap set core experimental.refresh-app-awareness=true

    # TODO: There is currently no way to unset configuration options.
