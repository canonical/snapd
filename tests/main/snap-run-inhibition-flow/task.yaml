summary: Check that snap run notifies the user about run inhibition due to refreshes.

details: |
    This test exercises the inhibition flow triggered when snap run is
    inhibited from running due to an onging refresh. When snap run is inhibited
    it record a snap-run-inhibit notice which should be parsed by another
    client (e.g. snapd-desktop-integration snap).

    TODO: Add a check for the text fallback
    If snap run detects that no snap has the marker interface connected and
    we are running in a terminal then snap run falls back to showing a text
    notification.

environment:
    SNAPD_INHIBIT_DIR: "/var/lib/snapd/inhibit"
