summary: Ensure our debs are correctly built

details: |
    When snapd is tested in Ubuntu and Debian, .deb files are created using
    the snapd code from the local branch.

    This test verifies that the debs have the 'built-using' header. It also
    checks that Apparmor & Seccomp are compiled (only in Ubuntu), that
    the snapd.session-agent.socket symlink is part of the deb and that
    it has the right (relative) target.

    echo "Ensure that our debs have the 'built-using' header"
    out=$(dpkg -I "$GOHOME"/snapd_*.deb)
