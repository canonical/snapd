summary: Check that download works with private using snapcraft v7+ export-login

details: |
    These tests rely on the existence of a snap in the remote store set to private.

    In order to do the full checks, it also needs the credentials of the owner of that
    snap set in the environment variables SPREAD_STORE_USER and SPREAD_STORE_PASSWORD

# run this only on main ubuntu classic systems,
# on many other distros installing classic snaps requires system-wide changes
# no ubuntu-core: we don't have expect available nor can we install snapcraft
# no ubuntu-18.04-32: no i386 version of snapcraft v7+ available anymore
systems: [ubuntu-1*-64, ubuntu-2*-64]

prepare: |
    echo "Install snapcraft from latest/candidate"
    snap install snapcraft --channel=latest/candidate --classic
    tests.cleanup defer snap remove --purge snapcraft

execute: |
    echo "Given account store credentials are available"
    # we don't have expect available on ubuntu-core, so the authenticated check need to be skipped on those systems
    if [ -n "$SPREAD_STORE_USER" ] && [ -n "$SPREAD_STORE_PASSWORD" ] && os.query is-classic; then
        echo "Export auth data via snapcraft"
        expect -f snapcraft-export-login.exp

        echo "Download the private snap using the exported auth data"
        UBUNTU_STORE_AUTH=$(cat creds) snap download test-snapd-private

        test -f test-snapd-private_*.snap
    fi
