summary: Ensure that the network-observe interface works

systems: [-debian-*]

details: |
    The network-observe interface allows a snap to query the network status information.

    A snap which defines the network-observe plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to access read the network status,
    the test sets up a network service to establish a known state in the network to be queried.

environment:
    PORT: 8081
    SERVICE_FILE: "./service.sh"
    SERVICE_NAME: "test-service"
