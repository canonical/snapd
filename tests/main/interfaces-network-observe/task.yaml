summary: Ensure that the network-observe interface works

details: |
    The network-observe interface allows a snap to query the network status
    information, using a dedicated unprivileged interface.

    A snap which defines the network-observe plug must be shown in the
    interfaces list. The plug must not be auto-connected on install and, as
    usual, must be able to be reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to access read the
    network status, the test sets up a network service to establish a known
    state in the network to be queried.
