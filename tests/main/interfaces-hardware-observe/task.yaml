summary: Ensure that the hardware-observe interface works.

summary: |
    The hardware-observe interface allows a snap to access hardware information.

    A snap which defines the hardware-observe plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be connected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to read files in /sys/{block,bus,class,devices}

    echo "Then the snap is able to read hardware information"
