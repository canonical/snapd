summary: Ensure that the hardware-observe interface works.

summary: |
    The hardware-observe interface allows a snap to access hardware information.

    A snap which defines the hardware-observe plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be connected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to read files in /sys/{block,bus,class,devices}

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring a plug on the hardware-observe interface is installed"
    snapbuild $TESTSLIB/snaps/hardware-observe-consumer .
    snap install --dangerous hardware-observe-consumer_1.0_all.snap

restore: |
    rm -f hardware-observe-consumer_1.0_all.snap hw.error

execute: |
    CONNECTED_PATTERN=":hardware-observe +hardware-observe-consumer"
    DISCONNECTED_PATTERN="(?s).*?\n- +hardware-observe-consumer:hardware-observe"

    echo "Then it is not connected by default"
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$DISCONNECTED_PATTERN"
