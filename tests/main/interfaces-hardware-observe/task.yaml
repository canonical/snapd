summary: Ensure that the hardware-observe interface works.

details: |
    The hardware-observe interface allows a snap to access hardware information.

    A snap which defines the hardware-observe plug must be shown in the
    interfaces list. The plug must not be connected on install and, as usual,
    must be able to be reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to read files in
    /sys/{block,bus,class,devices}

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring a plug on the hardware-observe interface is installed"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local hardware-observe-consumer

execute: |
    echo "The interface is not connected by default"
    snap interfaces -i hardware-observe | MATCH '^- +hardware-observe-consumer:hardware-observe'

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect hardware-observe-consumer:hardware-observe

    echo "Then the snap is able to read hardware information"
    hardware-observe-consumer.consumer

    if [ "$(snap debug confinement)" = partial ] ; then
        exit 0
    fi

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect hardware-observe-consumer:hardware-observe

    echo "Then the snap is not able to read the hardware information"
    if hardware-observe-consumer.consumer 2>hw.error; then
        echo "Expected permission error accessing locale configuration with disconnected plug"
        exit 1
    fi
    MATCH "Permission denied" < hw.error
