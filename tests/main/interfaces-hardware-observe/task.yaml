summary: Ensure that the hardware-observe interface works.

summary: |
    The hardware-observe interface allows a snap to access hardware information.

    A snap which defines the hardware-observe plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be connected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to read files in /sys/{block,bus,class,devices}

prepare: |
    . "$TESTSLIB/snaps.sh"

    echo "Given a snap declaring a plug on the hardware-observe interface is installed"
    install_local hardware-observe-consumer

restore: |
    rm -f hw.error

execute: |
    echo "The interface is not connected by default"
    snap interfaces | MATCH "\- +hardware-observe-consumer:hardware-observe"

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect hardware-observe-consumer:hardware-observe

    echo "Then the snap is able to read hardware information"
    hardware-observe-consumer.consumer

    if [ "$(snap debug confinement)" = partial ] ; then
        exit 0
    fi

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect hardware-observe-consumer:hardware-observe

    echo "Then the snap is not able to read the hardware information"
    if hardware-observe-consumer.consumer 2>hw.error; then
        echo "Expected permission error accessing locale configuration with disconnected plug"
        exit 1

    grep -q "Permission denied" hw.error
