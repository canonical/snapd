summary: Check that the ubuntu-core system is rebooted after the core snap is refreshed

details: |
    This test checks that when invoking a manual refresh/revert for core or core18 snaps,
    a reboot is triggered and the command would exit after the first phase of the installation
    reporting "snapd is about to reboot the system"

systems: [ubuntu-core-*]
