summary: Check that refreshes that require new base snaps work

details: |
    Verify that when a snap which doesn't have a base snap declared is
    refreshed and the new snap has a base snap declared, then the
    base snap is downloaded/installed in the system as part of the
    refresh process.

execute: |
    echo "Install a snap that requires no base snap"
    cp -a "$TESTSLIB"/snaps/test-snapd-requires-base-bare .
    sed -i '/^base:/d' test-snapd-requires-base-bare/meta/snap.yaml
    snap pack test-snapd-requires-base-bare
    snap install --dangerous test-snapd-requires-base-bare_1.0_all.snap
    if snap list | grep test-snapd-base-bare; then
        echo "ERROR: test-snapd-base-bare got pulled in"
        exit 1
    fi

    echo "Now refresh to the version in the store that has a base"
    snap refresh --edge --amend test-snapd-requires-base-bare

    echo "And ensure the base got pulled in"
    snap list | grep test-snapd-base-bare
