summary: Ensure that the uhid interface works.

details: |
    The uhid interface allows accessing the UHID to create kernel hid devices

    The test-snapd-uhid snap is able to create and destroy a device on /dev/uhid.

    The test checks the snap is able to manage devices on /dev/uhid, the
    interface is not connected by default and it can be connected and disconnected.

prepare: |
    echo "Given the uhid snap is installed"
    snap install test-snapd-uhid

restore: |
    rm -f call.error

execute: |
    echo "The plug is not connected by default"
    snap interfaces | MATCH "\- +test-snapd-uhid:uhid"

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect test-snapd-uhid:uhid

    echo "Exit when uhid is not supported, specially on cloud images"
    if [ ! -d /dev/uhid ]; then
        exit 0
    fi

    echo "Then the snap is able to create/destroy a device in /dev/uhid"
    test-snapd-uhid.test-device

    if [ "$(snap debug confinement)" = partial ]; then
        exit 0
    fi

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect test-snapd-uhid:uhid

    echo "Then the snap is not able to create/destroy a device on /dev/uhid"
    if test-snapd-uhid.test-device 2>${PWD}/call.error; then
        echo "Expected permission error calling uhid with disconnected plug"
        exit 1
    fi
    MATCH "Permission denied" < call.error
