summary: Check that transactional install/refresh of multiple snaps works

details: |
    A transactional update is an install or refresh operation on a set of snaps that either
    succeeds for all the snaps, or, if even one snap encounters an error, fails for all the
    entire set. If the process fails, all affected snaps revert to their state before the
    process started, even snaps that successfully updated.

    This test verifies that multiple snaps can be installed with the command 
    `snap install --transaction`. It is checked that when --transaction=all-snaps is used, the
    full transaction is reverted, and when --transaction=per-snap is used, only the one that
    failed is reverted.

    echo "Install multiple snaps from the store"
    snap install --transaction=all-snaps test-snapd-sh test-snapd-control-consumer
    snap list | MATCH test-snapd-sh
    snap list | MATCH test-snapd-control-consumer

    echo "Removing the snaps now"
    snap remove test-snapd-sh test-snapd-control-consumer
    not snap list test-snapd-sh
    not snap list test-snapd-control-consumer

    echo "Install multiple snaps from the store, one fails and the full transaction is reverted"
    not snap install --transaction=all-snaps test-snapd-sh nope
    not snap list test-snapd-sh
    not snap list nope

    echo "Install multiple snaps from the store, one fails and only that one is reverted"
    not snap install --transaction=per-snap test-snapd-sh nope
    not snap list nope
    snap list | MATCH test-snapd-sh
    snap remove test-snapd-sh
