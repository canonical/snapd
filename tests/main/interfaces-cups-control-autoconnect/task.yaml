summary: Test the auto-connect behaviour of the cups-control interface.

details: |
    The cups-control interface is provided as an implicit slot on
    classic systems. It is also provided as a slot by the cups
    snap. Normally snapd will not auto-connect a plug if there are
    multiple candidate slots available.

    However the cups-control interface is set up to only make one slot
    a candidate: if a non-snap cupsd appears to be on the system then
    system:cups-control is favoured. And if there is no non-snap
    cupsd, the reverse is true.

    - -ubuntu-core-*
    - -ubuntu-14.04*
