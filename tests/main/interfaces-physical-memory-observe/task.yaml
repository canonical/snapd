summary: Ensure that the physical memory observe interface works.

details: |
    The physical-memory-observe interface allows to read the physical memory.

    The test-snapd-physical-memory-observe snap checks that /dev/mem can be read
    and the interface can be connected and disconnected. 

# As the ubuntu kernels are configured with CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM=y, this interface is
# validated just in the other supported systems.
systems: [-ubuntu-*]
