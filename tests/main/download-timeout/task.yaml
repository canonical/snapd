summary: Test that downloads time-out on very slow connection.

details: |
  Test that snap download times out on a very slow connection. Download bandwidth
  is reduced with 'tc', and in addition the download parameters for snapd are
  tweaked for the test.

  ens3 is the interface for the external network and owns the Additional IP address
  in the subnet base with VLAN 0. ens4 is the interface for the internal network in
  the subnet infra with VLAN 1

systems: [ubuntu-18.04*, ubuntu-2*]

environment:
  # set minimum download speed that is a bit higher than the rate-limited speed set with tc.
  # also force a 15s window, so the test doesn't have to run for full 5 minutes (the default
  # window).
  SNAPD_MIN_DOWNLOAD_SPEED: 99000
  SNAPD_DOWNLOAD_MEAS_WINDOW: 15s
  OVERRIDES_FILE: /etc/systemd/system/snapd.service.d/local.conf
