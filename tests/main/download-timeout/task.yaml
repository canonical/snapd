summary: Test that downloads time-out on very slow connection.

details: |
  Test that snap download times out on a very slow connection. Download bandwidth
  is reduced with 'tc', and in addition the download parameters for snapd are
  tweaked for the test.

systems: [ubuntu-18.04*, ubuntu-2*]

environment:
  # set minimum download speed that is a bit higher than the rate-limited speed set with tc.
  # also force 1-minute window, so the test doesn't have to run for full 5 minutes (the default
  # window).
  SNAP_MIN_DOWNLOAD_SPEED: 99000
  SNAP_DOWNLOAD_MEAS_WINDOW: 1m
  OVERRIDES_FILE: /etc/systemd/system/snapd.service.d/env-overrides.conf
