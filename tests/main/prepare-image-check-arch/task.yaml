summary: Verify that we validate the architectures of snaps against the model

details: |
    Snapd contains intricate implementation details needed for the first-boot
    process, also known as seeding. It is only natural that it also carries
    logic for validating and preparing seed directories.

    The test prepares the environment to run "snap prepare-image", checking that
    the command validates if the architecture of the model and of the given
    snaps is compatible. Finally a correct set of arguments is used to show that
    the seed can be created successfully. Once the seed is created the test
    looks that certain key pieces, such as snaps and assertions, are in place.
