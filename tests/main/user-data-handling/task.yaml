summary: Check that the refresh data copy works.

details: |
    Snapd implements a system, where a refreshed snap's data associated with a
    particular revision is copied to the revision that a snap is being refreshed
    to. This allows the snap to perform destructive data manipulations, like
    schema changes, while simultaneously allowing the user to revert to the
    previously used revision for both the application code and user data.

    The test checks that snap user data is correctly copied for both root and
    non-root users.
