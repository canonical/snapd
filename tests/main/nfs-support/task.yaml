summary: Test that snaps still work when /home is a NFS mount

details: |
    Snapd now contains a feature where NFS-mounted /home (or any sub-directory)
    initializes a workaround mode where all snaps gain minimal amount of network
    permissions sufficient for NFS to operate.

# ubuntu-core: nfs service not available on core
# opensuse: the test is failing after retry several times the snapd service reaching the systemd start-limit.
