summary: Test that snaps still work when /home is a NFS mount

details: |
    Snapd now contains a feature where NFS-mounted /home (or any sub-directory)
    initializes a workaround mode where all snaps gain minimal amount of network
    permissions sufficient for NFS to operate.

# takes >1.5min to run
backends: [-autopkgtest]

# ubuntu-core: nfs service not available on core
# opensuse: the test is failing after retry several times the snapd service reaching the systemd start-limit.
# fedora, centos: disable until we figure out how to handle NFS and SELinux
#                 labels, labels can only be exported for NFSv4.2+ with security_label option
# ubuntu-14.04-64: group 'systemd-journal' does not exist
# amazon-linux-2023: nfs service unit does not exist
systems: [-ubuntu-core-*, -opensuse-*, -fedora-*, -centos-*, -ubuntu-14.04-64, -amazon-linux-2023-*]
