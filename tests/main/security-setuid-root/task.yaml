summary: Check that snap-wrap refuses to run unconfined 
details: |
    snap-wrap is setuid root but is only confined with an apparmor profile
    when invoked as a system-installed package or when running in the core from
    the usual location (/usr/lib/snapd/snap-wrap). As a security precaution
    it should detect and refuse to run if invoked from the core snap.

    # NOTE: This has to run as the test user because the protection is only
    # active if user gains elevated permissions as a result of using setuid
    # root snap-wrap.
