summary: Ensure that /dev/input/event* is allowed to slot snaps that need it

details: |
        The default policy disallows access to /dev/input/event* and snapd
        by default uses 'udevadm trigger --subsystem-nomatch=input'. Some slots
        like mir, wayland and x11 actually need access to /dev/input/event* and
        request snapd perform 'udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input'. For
        this test, use a snap that slots 'mir' since it is allowed on Core and
        classic distro. Also test that simply plugging 'mir' does not grant the
        access and that plugging mir with another interface (specifically,
        time-control) that trigger the device cgroup also does not.
