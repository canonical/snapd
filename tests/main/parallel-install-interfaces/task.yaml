summary: Check that snap connect with parallel installs works

details: |
    Snapd allows installation of the same snap more than once by combining the
    same snap name with different values of an instance key.

    Another aspect of the instance system is that plugs and slots are specific
    to the instance, allowing the system operator to connect or disconnect them
    individually.

    The test installs a pair of snaps and checks how interface connections are
    made between the application snaps and the core snap providing the slots.
    The test explores how auto-connection logic works and that the content
    interface is connected correctly.
