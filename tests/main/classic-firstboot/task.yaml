summary: Check that firstboot assertions are imported and snaps installed also on classic

details: |
  Verifies that the snapd.seeded.service unit is able to import assertions from
  the seed directory and install the seed snaps on classic systems. We verify
  this by creating a seed directory with the needed snaps and assertions and
  then starting the snapd.seeded.service unit. Additionally, we check that any
  services defined by the seed snaps are restarted before the mark-seeded task
  is completed.
