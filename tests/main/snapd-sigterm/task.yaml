summary: Ensure that snapd quits on SIGTERM

details: |
    This is a regression test for LP#1946656. We want to check that a pending
    connection can not prevent snapd from quitting.

restore: |
    echo "Restarting snapd"
    # No harm if it was already running
    systemctl start snapd.service

execute: |
    echo "Make a request, keep the connection open"
    python3 - << EOF > stamp &
    import socket, time
    s=socket.socket(socket.SOCK_STREAM,socket.AF_UNIX)
    s.connect('/run/snapd.socket')
    s.send(b'GET /v2/apps HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n')
    s.recv(10000)
    print('DONE', flush=True)
    time.sleep(60)
    EOF

    tests.cleanup defer rm -f stamp

    echo "Waiting for snapd reply..."
    retry -n 200 --wait 0.1 grep DONE stamp  # 20 seconds

    echo "Stopping snapd, and measuring time"
    TEST_TIME0="$(date +'%s')"
    systemctl stop snapd.service

    # The systemctl command waits for the operation to complete, but just to be
    # extra safe check that it's either inactive or has just been restarted. We
    # don't want to stop the socket itself, as that might hide the issue we
    # want to test.
    retry -n 100 --wait 0.1 sh -c 'systemctl status snapd.service | MATCH "inactive"'

    TEST_TIME1="$(date +'%s')"

    if ((TEST_TIME1 > TEST_TIME0 + 5)); then
        echo "Stopping snapd took more than 5 seconds!"
        exit 1
    fi
