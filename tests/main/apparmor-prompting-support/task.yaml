summary: Check that AppArmor Prompting support is as expected

details: |
    Test that AppArmor Prompting is supported on the systems for which support
    is expected (non-core Ubuntu systems from mantic on), and unsupported on
    all other systems.

prepare: |
    # Before enabling prompting, we must have a snap installed which provides
    # a prompting `handler-service` attribute with a connection via the
    # `snap-interfaces-requests-control` interface.

    # Prerequisite for having a prompts handler service
    snap set system experimental.user-daemons=true

    # Install a snap which identifies itself to snapd as a prompting handler-service
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-prompt-handler
    snap connect test-snapd-prompt-handler:snap-interfaces-requests-control

restore: |
    snap set system experimental.apparmor-prompting=false

execute: |
    echo "Precondition check that snapd is active"
    systemctl is-active snapd.service snapd.socket

    # Apparmor prompting feature is not supported in Ubuntu core
    if os.query is-core; then
        not snap set system experimental.apparmor-prompting=true >& err.out
        MATCH "cannot enable prompting feature as it is not supported on Ubuntu Core systems" < err.out

    # Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and 20.04 have kernels which don't support prompting.
    # For Ubuntu 22.04, the kernel doesn't support prompting except on google,
    # and the system AppArmor parser never supports it, so if we are not on
    # google or not using the snapd-vendored AppArmor via reexec, prompting is
    # not supported on jammy. This can occur because reexec is manually
    # disabled, or if the native snapd package on the system is of equal
    # version or newer than the tracked snapd snap.

        not snap set system experimental.apparmor-prompting=true >& err.out
        MATCH "cannot enable prompting feature as it is not supported by the system" < err.out
