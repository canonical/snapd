summary: Ensure that the udev interface backend works.

details: |
    This test checks that the udev rules file is created when a snap declaring
    a dependency on an interface (being it a slot or a plug) and that concrete
    dependency has a related udev snippet, then the udev rules files are created
    on install and removed after it is uninstalled.

    Currently the ony interface that declares a udev snippet is the modem-manager
    interface for its slot. This test can be easily extended with variants when
    more interfaces declare udev snippets.

prepare: |
    #shellcheck source=tests/lib/snaps.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB"/snaps.sh

    echo "Given a snap declaring a slot with associated udev rules is installed"
    install_local modem-manager-consumer

execute: |
    echo "Then the udev rules files specific to it are created"
    test -f /etc/udev/rules.d/70-snap.modem-manager-consumer.rules
    expected="ATTRS{idVendor}==\".*?\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\".*?\""
    grep -Pq "$expected" /etc/udev/rules.d/70-snap.modem-manager-consumer.rules

    echo "When the snap is removed"
    snap remove modem-manager-consumer

    echo "Then the udev rules files are removed"
    ! test -f /etc/udev/rules.d/70-snap.modem-manager-consumer.rules
