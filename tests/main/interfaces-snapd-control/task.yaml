summary: Ensure that the snapd-control interface works.

details: |
    The snapd-control interface allows a snap to access the locale configuration.

    A snap which defines the snapd-control plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to control the snapd daemon
    through the socket, the test snap used has a command to install a snap (exercising
    the write capability on the socket) and a command to list the installed snaps (which
    checks the read capability). A network plug must be defined and connected for the
    snap to be able to talk to the socket, the snapd-control is not enough by itself.
