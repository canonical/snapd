summary: check that the bluetooth-control interface works

details: |
    Check the bluetooth-control interface allows reading usb, class and dev under
    /sys directory. Verify the interface doesn't allow reading when it is disconnected.

# currently only enabled for the system that has bluetooth hardware (dragonboard)
systems: [ubuntu-core-16-arm-64]
