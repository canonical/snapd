summary: Test that snapd is not terminated by systemd on a slow startup

details: |
    This test checks that snapd is not terminated by systemd when it takes
    longer to start than the default timeout. The test simulates a slow startup
    by telling snapd to wait during startup (via SNAPD_SLOW_STARTUP) and a
    setting a systemd timeout that is shorter than the expected startup time.
    Internally, snapd will calculate the expected startup time based on the
    number of snaps and adjust systemd's timeout to match it.
