summary: Ensure that post-refresh hook has permissions for its connected slot.

# Note: it is critical for this test to use a slot that requires
# peer=<plug security tag> expression label for dbus, and not simply
# label=unconfined on a permanent slot snippet.

    Ensure that post-refresh hook has permissions to query upower-observe slot
    and enumerate upower devices.

      # start it in response to a dbus call from inside a snap (because the

      # the service would be started under, so it denies the startup).
