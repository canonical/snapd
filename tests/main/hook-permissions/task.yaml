summary: Ensure that post-refresh hook has permissions for its connected slot.

# Note: it is critical for this test to use a slot that requires
# peer=<plug security tag> expression label for dbus, and not simply
# label=unconfined on a permanent slot snippet.

    Ensure that post-refresh hook has permissions to query upower-observe slot
    and enumerate upower devices.
