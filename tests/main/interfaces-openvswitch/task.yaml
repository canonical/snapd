summary: Ensure that the openvswitch interface works.

systems: [-ubuntu-core-*]

details: |
    The openvswitch allows to talsk to the openvswitch socket (rw mode).

    A snap which defines a openvswitch plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to do all the operations that
    are carried through the socket, in this test we exercise bridge and port creation,
    list and deletion.

prepare: |
    echo "Given openvswitch is installed"
    apt install -y --no-install-recommends openvswitch-switch

    echo "And a snap declaring a plug on the openvswitch interface is installed"
    snap install --edge test-snapd-openvswitch-consumer

    echo "And a tap interface is defined"
    ip tuntap add tap1 mode tap

    ovs-vsctl del-br br0 || true

    apt-get remove -y --purge openvswitch-switch
    apt-get -y autoremove
