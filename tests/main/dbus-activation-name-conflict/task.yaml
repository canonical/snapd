summary: Test handling of D-Bus service name conflicts

details: |
    Ensure that the system does not allow two snaps to provide the same D-Bus
    service name. This is verified by installing a snap that provides a D-Bus
    service, and then expecting the installation a second snap that also provides
    the same service name to fail. Additionally, verify that refreshing a snap
    that provides a D-Bus service name works.
