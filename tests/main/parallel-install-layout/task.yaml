summary: Ensure that snap layouts work with parallel installed snaps
details: |
    This test installs a test snap that uses layout declarations. The snap is
    installed under its regular name as well as a parallel instance. The test
    verifies that the layout requested by snap works and operates only on the
    data owned by given snap instance.
