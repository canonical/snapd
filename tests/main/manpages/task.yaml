    # "nothing appropriate" message is shown when the "--what" parameter
    # is used for packages installed after man is installed. A workaround is
    # to the machine or force a cache consistency calling the man page with '-u'
    # This issue happens with any package, not just with snap related ones
    # The command "man snap" works well in this case (man 2.6.6)
