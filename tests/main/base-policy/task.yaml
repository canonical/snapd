summary: Ensure the default policy is correct for base and core bases

details: |
    Ideally we would check that:

    1. 'base: core' can access a core-only rule that 'base: other' cannot
    2. 'base: other' can access a base-only rule that 'base: core' cannot
    3. both can access something allowed by common rules

    While there are no core-only rules at this time for '1', we can at least
    test that 'grep --version' (differently allowed by core-only and
    base-only rules) does not get blocked. Combined with '2', this proves
    that that the 'base: core' snap has core-only policy but not base-only
    policy. Until we have a core-only rule that can be tested here, we'll
    rely on unit tests to ensure that base snaps don't have core-only rules).
