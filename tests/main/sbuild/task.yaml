    Use release-tools/debian-package-builder to interactively fix build
    issues. The debug shell created there shows the true layout of the source
    code as it exists during the build inside a debian system, inside the
    environment created by sbuild.

    In particular note that the source code exists twice in the build tree,
    and only the specific copy is being used.
