summary: Ensure the canonical-livepatch snap works on 14.04

details: |
    This is a specific 14.04 test that ensure live-patch work
    with a snapd that re-execs on 14.04. We don't regularly
    update the deb on 14.04 anymore so we need to be sure that
    re-exec is enough to run live-patch.

# livepatch works only on amd64 systems
systems: [ubuntu-14.04-64]

restore: |
    #shellcheck source=tests/lib/pkgdb.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB/pkgdb.sh"
    distro_install_build_snapd

execute: |
    echo "Keep a copy of the core snap with our latest snapd"
    cp /var/lib/snapd/snaps/core_*.snap .

    echo "And then install the snapd package from the trusty archive"
    #shellcheck source=tests/lib/pkgdb.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB"/pkgdb.sh
    distro_purge_package snapd

    echo "Install the snapd package from the trusty archive"
    apt update
    apt install snapd
    snap install --dangerous ./core_*.snap

    echo "Ensure snapd re-execs"
    SNAPD_DEBUG=1 snap list 2>&1 | MATCH "DEBUG: restarting into"
    
    echo "Ensure canonical-livepatch can be installed"
    snap install canonical-livepatch

    echo "Wait for it to respond"
    retry -n30 sh -c 'canonical-livepatch status 2>&1 | grep "Machine is not enabled"'

    echo "And ensure we get the expected status"
    canonical-livepatch status 2>&1 | MATCH "Machine is not enabled"
