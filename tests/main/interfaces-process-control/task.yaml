summary: Ensure that the process-control interface works.

systems: [-debian-*]

summary: |
    The process-control interface allows a snap to control other processes via signals
    and nice.

    A snap which defines the process-control plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to kill other processes. Currently
    this test does not check the priority change capability of the interface, will be
    extended later.

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring a plug on the process-control interface is installed"
    snapbuild $TESTSLIB/snaps/process-control-consumer .
    snap install --dangerous process-control-consumer_1.0_all.snap

restore: |
    rm -f process-control-consumer_1.0_all.snap process-kill.error process-nice.error
