summary: Ensure that the process-control interface works.

details: |
    The process-control interface allows a snap to control other processes via signals
    and nice.

    A snap which defines the process-control plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be auto-connected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to kill other processes. Currently
    this test does not check the priority change capability of the interface, will be
    extended later.
