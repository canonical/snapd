summary: "Check that snap services with 'install-mode: disable'"

details: |
    Snap package with service may choose to not enable them automatically, thus
    not start them automatically upon installation and after reboot, by using
    specific "install-mode: disable" in snap.yaml. Snap package may also choose
    to govern the install mode dynamically, with hooks that use "snapctl".

    The test installs a snap with such services and observes that the setting is
    respected. The test then checks that refreshing such snap does not break the
    property governed by "install-mode: disable". Lastly services like that may
    be enabled and retain their enabled state across refreshes. The test then
    follows up with another refresh to a different version to see how configured
    state is retained across refreshes.
