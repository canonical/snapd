summary: Verify that the theme REST API endpoints function correctly

details: |
    Snapd contains dedicated API for installation of snaps providing graphical
    themes. Themes are installed and configured by the user on the host system,
    but cannot necessarily be shared with installed snaps due to API and ABI
    compatibility issues. The theme API, which is governed by a snap interface
    and is available from sufficiently privileged snaps, allows checking if a
    given theme is installed, available for installation or not available at
    all. The same API allows requesting installation of additional themes.

    The test exercises this API from a helper snap, showing that the permission
    check governed by the interface works, and that once connected, the API can
    be used to manage themes as described above.
