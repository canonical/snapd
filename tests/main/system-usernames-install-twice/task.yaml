summary: ensure snap can be installed twice (reusing the created groups)

# List of expected snap install failures due to libseccomp/golang-seccomp being
# too old. Since the illegal name check happens after verifying system support,
# we can ignore these. Ignore ubuntu-core since groupdel doesn't support
# --extrausers
systems: [-amazon-linux-2-*, -centos-7-*, -ubuntu-14.04-*, -ubuntu-core-*]

prepare: |
    snap install --edge test-snapd-daemon-user

restore: |
    snap remove --purge test-snapd-daemon-user || true

    # snapd will create this for us, but we'll remove it for consistency in
    # test runs
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/user-state remove-with-group snap_daemon

execute: |
    echo "When the snap is removed"
    snap remove --purge test-snapd-daemon-user

    echo "Then the snap_daemon user and group remain"
    getent passwd snap_daemon || exit 1
    getent group snap_daemon || exit 1

    echo "And the snap can be installed again"
    snap install --edge test-snapd-daemon-user
