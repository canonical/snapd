summary: Ensure that `snap advise-snap` works

# On some slow external devices the test fails to restart snapd on restore
backends:
    - -external

# advise-snap / command-not-found only works on ubuntu classic, and on uc16
# on uc18+ we don't have the /usr/lib/command-not-found symlink so it's not
# useful
systems:
    - ubuntu-1*
    - ubuntu-2*
    - ubuntu-core-16*
