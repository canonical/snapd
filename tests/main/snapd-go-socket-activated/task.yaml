summary: Check that snapd goes into socket activated mode if there are no snaps

details: |
    Check that snapd initializes the system and then goes into socket activation
    mode if there are no snaps. The test verifies that the snap command keeps
    working, and we are able to start the snapd service by interacting with the
    snapd socket.

systems: [ubuntu-18.04-64]
