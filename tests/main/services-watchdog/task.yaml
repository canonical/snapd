summary: Check that snaps can use service-watchdog provided by systemd

details: |
    A snap service may define a watchdog timeout along with connecting
    to the daemon-notify slot. In this case the service must regularly
    notify systemd that it is still alive. If not, the service is
    considered failed.

    This test verifies that a service with watchdog that correctly
    notifies systemd remains running. And it also verifies a service that
    does not notify systemd is forcefully stopped.

# skip autopkgtest as this test is timing dependent and ADT is often
# very slow
