summary: Ensure that the nvidia-support interface works.

details: |
    The nvidia-support interface allows a snap to create character devices

    A snap which has access to the nvidia-support must be shown
    in the interfaces list. The plug must not be connected on install
    and, as usual, must be able to be reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to create
    /dev/nvidiactl.
