summary: Check that a service installed by a snap is reported as active by systemd

details: |
    Snap packages may contain applications that are marked as services. The test
    installs one such package and observes that the application is started as a
    systemd service.

environment:
    SERVICE_NAME: snap.test-snapd-service.test-snapd-service.service

execute: |
    echo "Given a service snap is installed"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-service

    echo "When the service state is reported as active"
    while ! systemctl show -p ActiveState "$SERVICE_NAME" | grep -Pq "ActiveState=active"; do sleep 0.5; done

    echo "Then systemctl reports the status of the service as loaded, active and running"
    expected='(?s).*?Loaded: loaded .*?Active: active \(running\)'
    systemctl status "$SERVICE_NAME" | grep -Pqz "$expected"
