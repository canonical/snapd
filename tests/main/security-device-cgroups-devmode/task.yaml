summary: Check that plugged and unplugged device nodes are available in devmode

details: |
    This tests that a framebuffer device is accessible in devmode and makes
    sure that other devices not included in the snap's plugged interfaces are
    still accessible (ie, the cgroup is not in effect).

prepare: |
    # Create framebuffer device node and give it some content we can verify
    # the test snap can read.
    if [ ! -e /dev/fb0 ]; then
        mknod /dev/fb0 c 29 0
        touch /dev/fb0.spread
    fi

    # Create a test char device so we can verify the test snap cannot read.
    if [ ! -e /dev/test1 ]; then
        mknod /dev/test1 c 29 1
        touch /dev/test1.spread
    fi
