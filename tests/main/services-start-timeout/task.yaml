summary: Check that snaps can use start-timeout

details: |
    Snaps may have forking services, which are expected to call fork() as part
    of start-up and the parent process is then expected to exit when start-up
    is complete.

    A forking service may have a `start-timeout` value set, where if the parent
    process does not exit within the given timeout, the installation fails.

    This test verifies that if a forking service fails to exit within the
    timeout, the installation fails, and if it does exit within the timeout,
    the installation is successful.

# this test is expected to fail once we run the tests for SELinux
# distros in Enforce mode

restore: |
    f=test-snapd-service-start-timeout/forking.sh
    if [ -e "$f.bak" ]; then
        mv -v "$f.bak" "$f"
    fi

execute: |
    dir=test-snapd-service-start-timeout

    # with the 30s sleep, start-timeout stops the snap from working
    not snap try "$dir"

    # drop the 'sleep 30'
    sed -i -e '/@@@/d' "$dir/forking.sh"

    snap try "$dir"
