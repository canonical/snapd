summary: smoke test for snap-update-ns
details: |
    Snapd is growing a new executable, snap-update-ns, to modify an existing
    mount namespace.  This is further documented on the forum here
    https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/fixing-live-propagation-of-mount-changes/23

    While the implementation matures this test checks that we call setns
    correctly (and it doesn't fail) enough that we reach the "not implemented"
    message that is currently in snap-updates-ns
environment:
    # I made far too many typos when those were literals in the code below.
    PLUG_SNAP: test-snapd-content-plug
    SLOT_SNAP: test-snapd-content-slot

    . $TESTSLIB/snaps.sh
    # NOTE: those are installed locally so that they are not connected because
    # of missing assertions. We are installing the slot before the plug snap so
    # that there's no attempt to load the default provider. Just in case
    # something changes we're disconnecting them so that tests are predictable.

    # need a namespace namespace.
