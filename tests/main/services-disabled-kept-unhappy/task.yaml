summary: Check that disabled snap services stay disabled across unhappy
  refreshes, reverts, and disable/enable cycles where undos are triggered (there
  is a separate tests for happy ops without undos, etc.)

details: |
  Snapd allows disabling snap services via the `snap stop --disable` command.

  This test is for the "unhappy" paths where, after the service is disabled,
  there is a refresh, revert or disable/enable cycle which fails and triggers
  an undo. Generally, tests that the service stays disabled. The following list
  shows the scenarios validated as part of this test:

  1. install snap, disable services, attempt refresh which gets undone
  2. install snap, disable services, attempt refresh with svc renames which gets undone
  3. install snap, refresh, disable services, attempt revert which gets undone
  4. install snap, disable services, refresh snap with svc changed into app, attempt revert which is undone
  5. install snap, disable services, refresh snap with svc renamed, disable services, attempt revert which is undone
  6. install snap, disable services, refresh snap with svc renamed, disable services, attempt refresh to revision without services which is undone
  7. install snap, disable services, refresh snap with svc renamed, disable services, attempt a refresh snap with new svc changed into app which is undone

# This test is for the "unhappy" paths for disabled services, where attempted
# refreshes, reverts, and disable/enable cycles fail and undos are triggered.
# This test covers the following cases:

# 1. install snap, disable services, attempt refresh which gets undone
#    => the services are disabled
#    => state.json doesn't have last-active-disabled-services

# 2. install snap, disable services, attempt refresh with svc renames which gets undone
#    => the services are disabled
#    => state.json doesn't have last-active-disabled-services

# 3. install snap, refresh, disable services, attempt revert which gets undone
#    => the services are disabled
#    => state.json doesn't have last-active-disabled-services

# 4. install snap, disable services, refresh snap with svc changed into app, attempt revert which is undone
#    => the services are disabled
#    => state.json doesn't have last-active-disabled-services

# 5. install snap, disable services, refresh snap with svc renamed, disable services, attempt revert which is undone
#    => the new service is still disabled
#    => state.json has the old service saved in last-active-disabled-services

# 6. install snap, disable services, refresh snap with svc renamed, disable services, attempt refresh to revision without services which is undone
#    => the new service is still disabled
#    => state.json has the old service saved in last-active-disabled-services

# 7. install snap, disable services, refresh snap with svc renamed, disable services, attempt a refresh snap with new svc changed into app which is undone
#    => the new services is still disabled
#    => state.json has the old service saved in last-active-disabled-services
