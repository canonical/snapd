summary: Check that the docker snap works basically

systems: [ubuntu-*]

environment:
    # downloading docker snap occasionally triggers OOM
    SNAPD_NO_MEMORY_LIMIT: 1

debug: |
  journalctl -u snap.docker.dockerd

execute: |
  if ! snap install docker; then
    echo "failed to install the docker snap!"
    exit 1
  fi

  # the retry here is because there's a race between installing the docker snap
  # and dockerd to be "ready" enough such that docker can talk to it properly
  retry -n 30 --wait 1 docker run hello-world | MATCH "installation appears to be working correctly"
