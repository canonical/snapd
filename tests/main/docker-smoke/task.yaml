details: |
  Verify the docker snap can be installed and run a hello-world.
  Also check it can be installed with --devmode.

systems: [ubuntu-*]

environment:
  # downloading docker snap occasionally triggers OOM

  CHANNEL: "latest/stable"
  IMAGE_URL: https://storage.googleapis.com/snapd-spread-tests/images/docker/hello-world.tar

    # the retry here is because there's a race between installing the docker snap
    # and dockerd to be "ready" enough such that docker can talk to it properly
    retry -n 30 --wait 1 docker run hello-world | MATCH "installation appears to be working correctly"

    # also check that the docker snap can be installed in devmode for some 
    # specific customer use cases related to microk8s
    snap remove docker --purge
    snap install --channel="$CHANNEL" docker --devmode

    # Interface docker0 is not removed when docker is uninstalled
    # This problem is reproduced with docker snap and deb packages
    # Rules added in iptables also are not working properly after
    # docker is removed. A reboot is recommended.
    snap remove docker --purge
