summary: Check that the docker snap works basically

details: |
  Verify the docker snap can be installed and run a hello-world.
  Also check it can be installed with --devmode.

systems: [ubuntu-*]

skip:
  - if: os.query is_resolute
    reason: Resolute's kernel requires Ubuntu flavors for this test to work. This test should be enabled when the kernel is ready.
