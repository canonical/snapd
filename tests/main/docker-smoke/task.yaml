details: |
  Verify the docker snap can be installed and run a hello-world.
  Also check it can be installed with --devmode.

    # the retry here is because there's a race between installing the docker snap
    # and dockerd to be "ready" enough such that docker can talk to it properly

    # also check that the docker snap can be installed in devmode for some 
    # specific customer use cases related to microk8s

    # Interface docker0 is not removed when docker is uninstalled
    # This problem is reproduced with docker snap and deb packages
    # Rules added in iptables also are not working properly after
    # docker is removed. A reboot is recommended.
