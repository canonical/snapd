summary: Ensure that the squashfs precondition check works

details: |
    Check that if the precondition check of a squashfs mount fails when snapd
    is restarted, the precondition is checked and the journal log shows the message
    "cannot mount squashfs image"

prepare: |
    echo "Break mounting so that the precondition check of a squashfs mount fails"
    mount -o bind /bin/false /bin/mount

restore: |
    echo "Undoing the mount breakage"
    umount /bin/mount
    systemctl restart snapd

execute: |
    echo "Restart snapd so that the precondition check runs"
    systemctl restart snapd
    tests.systemd wait-for-service -n 30 --state active snapd

    "$TESTSTOOLS"/journal-state match-log -n 120 -u snapd "system does not fully support snapd: cannot mount squashfs image"

    echo "Ensure precondition check error is reported in the journal"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/journal-state get-log -u snapd | MATCH "system does not fully support snapd: cannot mount squashfs image"

    echo "Ensure GET commands still work"
    snap list | MATCH core
    
    echo "Ensure snap commands reply with precondition check error"
    snap install test-snapd-sh 2>&1 | MATCH "system does not fully support snapd: cannot mount squashfs image"
