summary: Check that device nodes are available in classic

details: |
    This tests that a framebuffer device is accessible in classic and makes
    sure that other devices are still accessible (ie, the cgroup is not in
    effect).

# Disabled on Fedora, Ubuntu Core and Arch because they don't support classic
# confinement.
systems: [-fedora-*, -ubuntu-core-*, -arch-*, -amazon-*, -centos-*]

prepare: |
    # Create framebuffer device node and give it some content we can verify
    # the test snap can read.
    if [ ! -e /dev/fb0 ]; then
        mknod /dev/fb0 c 29 0
        touch /dev/fb0.spread
    fi

    echo "Given a snap declaring a plug on framebuffer is installed in classic"

    if [ -e /dev/fb0.spread ]; then
        rm -f /dev/fb0 /dev/fb0.spread
