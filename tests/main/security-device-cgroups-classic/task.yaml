summary: Check that device nodes are available in classic

details: |
    This tests that a framebuffer device is accessible in classic and makes
    sure that other devices are still accessible (ie, the cgroup is not in
    effect).

systems: [-fedora-*, -opensuse-*]

prepare: |
    # Create framebuffer device node and give it some content we can verify
    # the test snap can read.

        mknod /dev/fb255 c 29 255
        touch /dev/fb255.spread
    fi
