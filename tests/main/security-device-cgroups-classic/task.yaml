summary: Check that device nodes are available in classic

details: |
    This tests that a framebuffer device is accessible in classic and makes
    sure that other devices are still accessible (ie, the cgroup is not in
    effect).

# Disabled on Fedora, Ubuntu Core and Arch because they don't support classic
# confinement.
systems: [-fedora-*, -ubuntu-core-*, -arch-*]

prepare: |
    # Create framebuffer device node and give it some content we can verify
    # the test snap can read.
