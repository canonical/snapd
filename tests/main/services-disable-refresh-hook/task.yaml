    Check that `snapctl stop --disable` actually stops services on post-refresh

details: |
    Install a snap with both simple and forking services running and a refresh
    hook which includes `snapctl stop --disable`, then check that the refresh
    hook successfully stops those services when the snap is refreshed.

execute: |
    echo "Installing snap first time starts services"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-svcs-disable-refresh-hook

    echo "Services are running after install hook"
    for service in simple forking; do
        echo "Verify that the $service service isn't running"
        snap services | MATCH "test-snapd-svcs-disable-refresh-hook\\.$service\\s+enabled\\s+active"
    done

    echo "Refreshing the snap triggers post-refresh hook which disables the services"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-svcs-disable-refresh-hook

    echo "Services are now disabled"
    for service in simple forking; do
