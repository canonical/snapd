summary: Ensure exit code for retryable error works

details: |
    In snapd, the retryable errors are the ones that can be retried later, and 
    snapd uses a different exit code for retryable errors.
    
    This test forces an error installing 2 times the same snap and checks the
    exit code for the the retryable error is 10.

# autopkgtest is sometimes super slow and this test is timing dependent
backends: [-autopkgtest]

execute: |
    echo "Install a snap which takes some time to be installed"
    snap pack test-snapd-sleep-install
    snap install --dangerous test-snapd-sleep-install_*.snap &

    echo "And try to install it again which results in a change conflict error"
    while true; do
        snap changes
        if snap changes | grep "Doing.*Install"; then
            if snap install --dangerous test-snapd-sleep-install_*.snap; then
                echo "snap install should return a change-conflict: test broken"
                exit 1
            else
                errCode=$?
                if [ $errCode != 10 ]; then
                    echo "go unexpected err code $errCode (expecting 10)"
                    exit 1
                fi
            fi
            break
        fi
