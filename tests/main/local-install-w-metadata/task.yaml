summary: Checks for local install with metadata from assertions

details: |
    Snapd couples each snap package with an assertion document that provides
    trusted properties, such as revision number. A typical installation request
    downloads both files from the store, but the files may be equally well
    downloaded and installed separately. The resulting installation is
    indistinguishable from an online installation. Crucially, the user is no
    longer required to use the "--dangerous" flag.

    echo "Get the snap"

    echo "Try to install the snap without assertions"

    echo "Add its assertions"
    snap ack test-snapd-sh_*.assert
