summary: Check that plugged and unplugged device nodes are available in strict

details: |
    This tests that a framebuffer device is accessible in strict and makes
    sure that other devices not included in the snap's plugged interfaces are
    still accessible (ie, the cgroup is not in effect).

systems: [-fedora-*, -opensuse-*,-debian-*, -arch-*, -amazon-*, -centos-*]

prepare: |
    # Create framebuffer device node and give it some content we can verify
    # the test snap can read.
