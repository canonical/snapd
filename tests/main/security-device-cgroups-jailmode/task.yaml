summary: Check that plugged and unplugged device nodes are available in jailmode

details: |
    This tests that a framebuffer device is accessible in jailmode and makes
    sure that other devices not included in the snap's plugged interfaces are
    still accessible (ie, the cgroup is not in effect).

# None of those systems support strict confinement which is required to formally enable jailmode.
systems: [-fedora-*, -opensuse-*, -debian-*, -arch-*, -amazon-*, -centos-*]

    # the test snap can read.
