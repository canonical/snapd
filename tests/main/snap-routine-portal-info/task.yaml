summary: The portal-info command provides information about a confined process

details: |
    The "snap routine portal-info" command is intended to be a helper for
    xdg-desktop-portal. When xdg-desktop-portal needs to know some of the
    information about a process, possibly a flatpak or a snap, it performs some
    set of checks and may choose to call the "snap routine portal-info" with the
    ID of the process being investigated.

    This allows XDG portals to support unconfined and confined apps, and equally
    support confinement systems other than flatpak alone, without having to
    maintain complex knowledge about how snapd sandbox works on a given day.

    The test runs a snap command which has a matching desktop entry, records the
    PID number and uses the "portal-info" routine to show that snapd correctly
    accounts the PID to the snap and displays specific meta-data in ini format
    expected by the XDG portal logic.
