summary: Check that `snap set` runs configure hook.

details: |
    The `snap set` command modifies configuration options for snaps. As part of
    this process, configure hooks defined in the snap are run. This test checks
    the following scenarios related to `snap set`:

    1. If a snap has no configure hook defined, `snap set` fails.

    2. If a configure hook errors, `snap set` fails.

    3. Configuration options set via `snap set` can be retrieved by the
    resulting configure hook.

    4. Configuration options can be set to `null`, which removes the option.

    5. Configuration options can be unset, which removes the option.

    6. Setting an invalid key results in an error.

    7. If a snap has a configure hook which results in an error, installation
    of the snap fails.

    8. If `snap set` is called multiple times, the order in which these calls
    are handled is deterministic, with the most recent value set for a given
    option taking precedence.
