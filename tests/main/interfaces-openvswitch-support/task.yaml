summary: Ensure that the openvswitch-support interface works.

details: |
    The openvswitch-support interface allows to access to /run/uuidd/request

# ubuntu-core, ubuntu-14, fedora, amazon are skipped as /run/uuidd/request file does not
# exist. On those systems different files are being used instead.
# arch: uses /run/run/uuidd/request, filed a bug report https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/58122
systems: [-ubuntu-14.04-*,-ubuntu-core-*,-fedora-*, -arch-*, -amazon-*]
