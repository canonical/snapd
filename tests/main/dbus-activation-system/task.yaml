summary: D-Bus system services support activation

details: |
    Verify that services that are activated via the D-Bus system bus are started
    when a method call is made to them and that they are stopped when the snap
    is removed.

prepare: |
    snap set system experimental.user-daemons=true

restore: |
    snap unset system experimental.user-daemons
