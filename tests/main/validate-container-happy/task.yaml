summary: check the symlinks following the right track

details: |
    Snapd contains logic to validate the contents of a snap to ensure that
    symbolic links follow certain restrictions. The test mounts a snap with
    crafted symbolic link names and targets, containing spaces and the character
    sequence ->, to check that snapd is not confused by that structure, and that
    after mounting, the symlinks retain their properties.

environment:
    SNAP: test-snapd-validate-container-happy

    # We shouldn't use relative symlinks in Github as they cannot be packed correctly.
    # So here let's test whether we can still pack such symlinks within a snap and use if needed.
    # First we "try" to unpack the snap structure and untar the symlinks
    # Then we pack the snap with these symlinks and then install
    # Finally we check to see if the symlinks actually support the intervined symlinks

    # Untar the symlinks 
    tar -xvf "$SNAP"/hell/hell.tar -C "$SNAP"/hell

    snap try "$SNAP"
    # Check to see if the symlinks point to the right paths
