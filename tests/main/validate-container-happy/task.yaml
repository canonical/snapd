    # We shouldn't use relative symlinks in Github as they cannot be packed correctly.
    # So here let's test whether we can still pack such symlinks within a snap and use if needed.
    # First we "try" to unpack the snap structure and untar the symlinks
    # Then we pack the snap with these symlinks and then install
    # Finally we check to see if the symlinks actually support the intervined symlinks

    # Untar the symlinks
