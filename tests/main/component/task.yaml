details: |
  Verifies that basic snap component operations (install, refresh, remove) work.

systems: [ubuntu-16.04-64, ubuntu-18.04-64, ubuntu-2*, ubuntu-core-*]

execute: |
  # Build snap and component
  snap pack snap-with-comps/
  snap pack comp1/

  # Installing component without snap should fail
  if snap install --dangerous snap-with-comps+comp1_1.0.comp; then
      exit 1
  fi

  # Install snap and component
  snap install --dangerous snap-with-comps_1.0_all.snap
  chg_id=$(snap install --no-wait --dangerous snap-with-comps+comp1_1.0.comp)
  snap watch "$chg_id"

  # Chech component install change was as expected
  snap change "$chg_id" | MATCH "^Done .*Prepare component"
  snap change "$chg_id" | MATCH "^Done .*Mount component"
  snap change "$chg_id" | MATCH "^Done .*Make component .* available to the system"

  # File has been copied around
  comp_inst_path=/var/lib/snapd/snaps/snap-with-comps+comp1_x1.comp
  stat "$comp_inst_path"

  # Component is mounted (note that we need to escape the "+" in the path)
  mount | MATCH "^${comp_inst_path/+/\\+} on /snap/snap-with-comps/components/x1/comp1.*"
  # and is seen from snap app
