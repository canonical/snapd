summary: ensure that the Wayland interface can connect to confined servers

details: |
    An unmodified Wayland compositor will create its listening socket
    in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR. If it is strictly confined, this will be in
    the snap's private subdirectory.

    Even if we hard link that socket to the real $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, the
    AppArmor rules governing access will use the path it was
    originally bound at. This test verifies that connection is
    possible.
