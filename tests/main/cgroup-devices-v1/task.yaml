summary: measuring basic properties of device cgroup

details: |
    Verify some basic properties of the device cgroups v1. Some checks are:
    The device cgroup of the main process is the expected one.
    The initial constraints imposed by the device cgroup made by systemd.
    After a connection is done, the device cgroup is updated accordingly.
    The main process for a snap is in the snapd-made cgroup after a command
    is executed via snap-confine.

# Disable the test on all systems that boot with cgroup v2
