summary: Check that snap restarts affects only running or enabled services

details: |
    When a snap is restarted, each of its services should be restarted so long
    as the service in question is either running or enabled. This is the case
    regardless of whether the `--reload` argument is given. This test checks the
    following scenarios.

    1. disabled and running -> restart -> running
    2. enabled and running -> restart -> running
    3. disabled and stopped -> restart -> stopped
    4. enabled and stopped -> restart -> running

    Additionally, if a service is explicitly mentioned in the command line
    arguments of `snap restart`, it should be always be restarted, regardless
    of its current state. The test checks this as well.

    5. disabled and stopped -> explicitly restart service by name -> running

environment:
    EXTRA_FLAGS/restart: ""
    EXTRA_FLAGS/reload: "--reload"
