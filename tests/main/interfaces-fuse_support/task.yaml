summary: Ensure that the fuse-support interface works.

# no support for fuse on 14.04
systems: [-ubuntu-14.04-64, -ubuntu-14.04-32]

details: |
    The fuse-support interface allows a snap to manage FUSE file systems.

    A snap which defines the fuse-support plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to create a fuse filesystem
    in a writable zone. The fuse-consumer test snap creates a readable file with a known
    name and content in the mount point given to the command.

environment:
    MOUNT_POINT: /var/snap/test-snapd-fuse-consumer/current/mount_point

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring a fuse plug is installed"
    snap install test-snapd-fuse-consumer

    echo "And a user writable mount point is created"
    mkdir -p $MOUNT_POINT

restore: |
    umount $MOUNT_POINT || true
    rm -rf $MOUNT_POINT fuse.error

execute: |
    . "$TESTSLIB/names.sh"

    CONNECTED_PATTERN=":fuse-support +test-snapd-fuse-consumer"
    DISCONNECTED_PATTERN="(?s).*?\n- +test-snapd-fuse-consumer:fuse-support"

    echo "Then the fuse plug is not connected by default"
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$DISCONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "Then the snap is not able to create a fuse file system"
    if test-snapd-fuse-consumer.create $MOUNT_POINT 2>${PWD}/fuse.error; then
        echo "Expected permission error creating fuse filesystem with disconnected plug"
        exit 1
    fi
    grep -q "Permission denied" fuse.error

    echo "==================================="

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect test-snapd-fuse-consumer:fuse-support ${core_name}:fuse-support
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$CONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "Then the snap is able to create a fuse filesystem"
    test-snapd-fuse-consumer.create $MOUNT_POINT
    PID=$(ps aux | grep test-snapd.*create | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')
    grep -q "Hello World!" /proc/${PID}/root/$MOUNT_POINT/hello
    kill -9 ${PID}
