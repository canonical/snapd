summary: Ensure that the fuse-support interface works.

# no support for fuse on 14.04
systems: [-ubuntu-14.04-*]

details: |
    The fuse-support interface allows a snap to manage FUSE file systems.

    A snap which defines the fuse-support plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to create a fuse filesystem
    in a writable zone. The fuse-consumer test snap creates a readable file with a known
    name and content in the mount point given to the command.

environment:
    MOUNT_POINT: /var/snap/test-snapd-fuse-consumer/current/mount_point

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring a fuse plug is installed"
    snap install test-snapd-fuse-consumer

    echo "And a user writable mount point is created"
    mkdir -p "$MOUNT_POINT"

restore: |
    # remove the mount point
    mounts=$(nsenter --mount=/run/snapd/ns/test-snapd-fuse-consumer.mnt cat /proc/mounts | \
             grep "$(basename "$MOUNT_POINT") fuse" | cut -f2 -d' ')
    for m in $mounts; do
        nsenter --mount=/run/snapd/ns/test-snapd-fuse-consumer.mnt umount "$m"
    done
    rm -rf "$MOUNT_POINT" fuse.error

    if [ "$(snap debug confinement)" = strict ] ; then
        echo "Then the snap is not able to create a fuse file system"
        if test-snapd-fuse-consumer.create -f "$MOUNT_POINT" 2> fuse.error; then
            echo "Expected permission error creating fuse filesystem with disconnected plug"
            exit 1
