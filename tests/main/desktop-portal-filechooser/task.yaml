summary: the desktop portal file choosers provide access to files

details: |
    The xdg-desktop-portal file chooser interface provides a way for a
    confined application to request access to any file the user can
    read/write.

    The choice of which file is handled via an out-of-process file
    chooser running outside of confinement, and the file itself is
    then made available to the sandbox via the xdg-document-portal
    FUSE file system.

    This test substitutes in a replacement for the file chooser UI,
    but otherwise uses the real xdg-desktop-portal and
    xdg-document-portal services.

# Only enable the test on systems we know portals to function on.
# Expand as needed.
# ubuntu-18.04-*: Ships xdg-desktop-portal 0.11

    # The python code does open(path, 'w'), which attempts to truncate the
    # file if it exists. Then in fuse handlers inside document-portal, the
    # code path for when the inode exists and the caller requested O_TRUNC,
    # returns -ENOSYS, resulting in OSError:
    # [Errno 38] Function not implemented on the Python side
    # Creating the file beforehand prevents that.

    # TODO: another workaround for testing on 18.04
    # Retry checking until the file contains the written text. In particular on
    # 18.04, xdg-desktop-portal 0.11 (perhaps still the same for later
    # versions), the writes were implemented such that the client writes to a
    # fuse filesystem entry, while the portal forwards the writes to the actual
    # backing file. It was observed that, even after client does close and the
    # corresponding *fuse_release() code completes on the portal side, the
    # contents are not visible in the destination file.
