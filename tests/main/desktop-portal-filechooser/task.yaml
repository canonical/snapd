summary: the desktop portal file choosers provide access to files
description: |
    The xdg-desktop-portal file chooser interface provides a way for a
    confined application to request access to any file the user can
    read/write.

    The choice of which file is handled via an out-of-process file
    chooser running outside of confinement, and the file itself is
    then made available to the sandbox via the xdg-document-portal
    FUSE file system.

    This test substitutes in a replacement for the file chooser UI,
    but otherwise uses the real xdg-desktop-portal and
    xdg-document-portal services.

# Only enable the test on systems we know portals to function on.
# Expand as needed.
systems:
    # Ships xdg-desktop-portal 0.11
    - ubuntu-18.04-*

    # Ships xdg-desktop-portal 1.2.0
