summary: Ensure that the alsa interface works.

# Spread system for Fedora, openSUSE and AMZN2 don't seem to provide any /dev/snd entries
systems: [-fedora-*, -opensuse-*, -amazon-*]

details: |
    The alsa interface allows connected plugs to access raw ALSA devices.

    A snap which defines a alsa plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to
    be reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to access to raw ALSA
    devices, for this test we check the low level security rules by creating
    specific devices under /dev/snd, a cgroup if needed and the ALSA state dir,
    exercising in each caase the read or read-write permissions that must be in
    place.
