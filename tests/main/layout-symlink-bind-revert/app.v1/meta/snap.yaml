# The application expects the runtime to be installed in /opt/runtime
# We are using the layout system to put $SNAP/runtime in /opt/runtime but at
# the same time the content interface allows us to mount the runtime in
# $SNAP/runtime. With the right propagation options the mount event in
# $SNAP/runtime is propagated into /opt/runtime
