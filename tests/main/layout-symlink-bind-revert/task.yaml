summary: Layouts can change from one revision to another
details: |
    This test used to show how layouts could *not* change, in some cases, from
    one version to another due to bugs in mount namespace mechanics. With those
    bugs fixed the test now shows how everything behaves correctly.

prepare: |
    echo "Ensure feature flag is enabled"
    snap set core experimental.layouts=true
    echo "Prepare the snaps we're going to use"
    snap pack ./runtime .
    snap pack ./app.v1 .
    snap pack ./app.v2 .

execute: |
    echo "The runtime and the application are installed and connected"
    snap install --dangerous ./runtime_1_all.snap
    snap install --dangerous ./app_1_all.snap
    snap connect app:runtime runtime:runtime
    app 2>&1 | MATCH "RUNTIME: Hello from the app"

    echo "The application is refreshed with another layout"
    snap install --dangerous ./app_2_all.snap
    app 2>&1 | MATCH "RUNTIME: Hello from the app"

    echo "The broken application is reverted"
    snap revert app 2>&1 | MATCH 'app reverted to 1'
    app 2>&1 | MATCH "RUNTIME: Hello from the app"
