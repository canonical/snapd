summary: Ensure that the cups interface works.

details: |
    The cups-control interface allows a snap to access the locale configuration.

    A snap which defines the cups-control plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to talk to the cups daemon.
    The test snap used pulls the lpr functionality and installs a pdf printer. In order
    to actually connect to the socket it needs to declare a plug on the network interface.
    The test checks for the existence of a pdf file generated by the lpr command in the
    snap.

environment:
    TEST_FILE: /var/snap/cups-control-consumer/current/test_file.txt

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring a cups plug is installed"
    snap install test-snapd-cups-control-consumer

    echo "And the pdf printer is available"
    apt install -y printer-driver-cups-pdf

restore: |
    apt remove -y printer-driver-cups-pdf
    apt autoremove -y
    rm -rf $HOME/PDF $TEST_FILE print.error

    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$DISCONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "===================================="

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect cups-control-consumer:cups-control ubuntu-core:cups-control
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$CONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "Hello World" > $TEST_FILE
