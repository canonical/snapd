summary: Ensure that the cups interface works.

systems: [-ubuntu-core-16-*]

details: |
    The cups-control interface allows a snap to access the locale configuration.

    A snap which defines the cups-control plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to talk to the cups daemon.
    The test snap used pulls the lpr functionality and installs a pdf printer. In order
    to actually connect to the socket it needs to declare a plug on the network interface.
    The test checks for the existence of a pdf file generated by the lpr command in the
    snap.

    TEST_FILE: /var/snap/test-snapd-cups-control-consumer/current/test_file.txt
