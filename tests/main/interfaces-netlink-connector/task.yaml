summary: Ensure that the netlink connector interface works.

details: |
    The netlink-connector interface allows communication through the kernel netlink connector.

    The test-snapd-netlink-connector snap creates a netlink socket and binds it. 

prepare: |
    . $TESTSLIB/snaps.sh

    # Install a snap declaring a plug on netlink-connector
    install_local test-snapd-netlink-connector

execute: |
    echo "The interface is not connected by default"
    snap interfaces | MATCH "\- +test-snapd-netlink-connector:netlink-connector"

    echo "When the interface is connected"
    snap connect test-snapd-netlink-connector:netlink-connector

    echo "Then the snap is able to create and bind a netlink socket"
    test-snapd-netlink-connector.bind

    if [ "$(snap debug confinement)" = partial ] ; then
        exit 0
    fi

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect test-snapd-netlink-connector:netlink-connector

    echo "Then the snap is not able to bind the netlink socket"
    if test-snapd-netlink-connector.bind; then
        echo "Expected permission error creating/binding a netlink socket"
        exit 1
    fi
