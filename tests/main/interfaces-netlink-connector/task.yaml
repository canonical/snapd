summary: Ensure that the netlink connector interface works.

details: |
    The netlink-connector interface allows communication through the kernel netlink connector.

    The test-snapd-netlink-connector snap creates a netlink socket and binds it. 

environment:
    CONNECTED_PATTERN: ':netlink-connector +test-snapd-netlink-connector'
    DISCONNECTED_PATTERN: '\- +test-snapd-netlink-connector:netlink-connector'

prepare: |
    . $TESTSLIB/snaps.sh

    # Install a snap declaring a plug on netlink-connector
    install_local test-snapd-netlink-connector

execute: |
    echo "The interface is not connected by default"
    snap interfaces | MATCH "$DISCONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "When the interface is connected"
    snap connect test-snapd-netlink-connector:netlink-connector
    snap interfaces | MATCH "$CONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "Then the snap is able to create and bind a netlink socket"
    test-snapd-netlink-connector.bind

    if [ "$(snap debug confinement)" = partial ] ; then
        exit 0

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect test-snapd-netlink-connector:netlink-connector
