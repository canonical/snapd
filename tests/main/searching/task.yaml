summary: Check snap search

details: |
    Check that `snap find` lists snaps that match the search terms, if any are
    provided. Check that results can be obtained from partial matches and even
    from a specific section, if --section is used. Check that `snap find` lists
    featured snaps if no search terms are provided. Check that the results
    include snaps in the beta and edge channels.
