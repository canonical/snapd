summary: Ensure that Kerberos tickets integration works

details: |
    Snap_run overwrites the Kerberos cache via the environment.
    Check that that is working as expected.

    Also ensure that the snap can read a ticket in the cache
    if and only if the kerberos-ticket interface is connected,
    and can never write to it.

environment:
    TICKET: /tmp/krb5cc_test #Must initiate with /tmp/krb5cc_
    TICKET_CONTENTS: contents
    KRB5CCNAME: FILE:$TICKET
    # Snap_run will overwrite the original KRB5CCNAME
    EXPECTED_KRB5CCNAME: FILE:/var/lib/snapd/hostfs/tmp/krb5cc_test

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring a plug on the kerberos-tickets interface is installed"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local kerberos-tickets-consumer

    echo "Mock the kerberos ticket at $TICKET"
    echo "$TICKET_CONTENTS" > "$TICKET"

execute: |
    echo "KRB5CCNAME was correctly overwritten in the snap's environment."
    kerberos-tickets-consumer | tr -s / | MATCH "KRB5CCNAME:$EXPECTED_KRB5CCNAME"

    echo "The interface is disconnected by default"
    snap interfaces -i kerberos-tickets | MATCH -- '^- +kerberos-tickets-consumer:kerberos-tickets'

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect kerberos-tickets-consumer:kerberos-tickets

    if snap debug sandbox-features --required apparmor:kernel:file; then
        echo "Then the snap command can rean read the Kerberos ticket, but not write to it"
        kerberos-tickets-consumer | MATCH "$TICKET_CONTENTS"
        kerberos-tickets-consumer | MATCH "cannot write to ticket"

        echo "When the plug is disconnected"
        snap disconnect kerberos-tickets-consumer:kerberos-tickets

        echo "Then the snap command can neither read the Kerberos ticket nor write to it"
        kerberos-tickets-consumer | MATCH "cannot read ticket"
        kerberos-tickets-consumer | MATCH "cannot write to ticket"

        export KRB5CCNAME=FILE:/a/b/c
