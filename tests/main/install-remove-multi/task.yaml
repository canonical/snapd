summary: Check that install/remove of multiple snaps works

details: |
    Check that installing multiple snaps and removing them with and without
    `--purge` results in snapshots being saved or not, accordingly. Check that
    installing a snap with a desktop file creates a corresponding desktop file
    and that it's deleted once the snap is removed.
