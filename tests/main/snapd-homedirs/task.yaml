summary: Test support for non-standard home directory paths and data copy between revisions

details: |
    Verifies that the snap data in non-standard home directories gets properly copied between
    revisions when the snap package is refreshed to a newer revision. Also makes sure that the
    snap data in non-standard home directories is deleted when the snap package is removed.

systems:
    - -ubuntu-core-*  # Home dirs cannot be changed
    - -centos-*       # No AppArmor support
    - -fedora-*       # No AppArmor support
    - -amazon-linux-* # No AppArmor support

environment:
    USERNAME: home-sweet-home
