summary: when the base snap changes revision apps are not stuck on the stale one

details: |
    When a snap application starts running the mount namespace it inhabits is
    preserved and cached across all the applications belonging to a given snap.
    This gives the system the feeling of integrity as all processes belonging
    to that snap have the same filesystem view. When the base snap revision
    changes (potentially bringing in important bug and security fixes) the
    mount namespace is not immediately re-created. As long as application
    process inhabit the old mount namespace it will stay as is. When the last
    process dies the subsequently started process will detect those two facts
    (stale and unused mount namespace) and discard it.
