summary: Check confdb cross-snap configuration

details: |
  Check that we can configure confdbs across snaps and that the appropriate
  hooks are invoked.

# the test snaps have a core24 base not supported on 16.04.
# This conflicts with other tests on debian11 in a way that breaks snap-confine
# (which this test runs many times due the hook calls).
systems: [ -ubuntu-16.04, -debian-11-64 ]

prepare: |
  snap set system experimental.confdbs=true

restore: |
  snap unset system experimental.confdbs
