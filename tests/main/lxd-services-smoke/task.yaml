summary: Ensure refreshing lxd snap after service commands works.

details: |
  Execute a set of operations on lxd snap that were known to render it unusable
  due to a combination of three problems: remove hook of lxd snap didn't clean
  its mountpoints properly in namespace of the host, causing error when removing
  snap data; snapd wouldn't ignore errors on snap data removal, triggering undo
  on remove; remove would fail completely on undo, leaving lxd snap in an
  undefined state. With fixed lxd remove hook and snapd fixes related to
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1899614, this test should never fail on
  any of the above.

systems: [ubuntu-18.04*, ubuntu-20.04*]

execute: |
  echo "Installing lxd snap"
  snap install lxd
  snap stop lxd
  snap start lxd

  # This may fail if revision is same as stable
  snap refresh --edge lxd || true

  # Critical operation: depends on correct lxd remove hook that
  # unmounts its mountpoints properly in the namespace of the host.
  # If the hook is not doing the right thing, then remove should still
  # succeed but we will fail with leftovers in /var/snap/lxd/common.
  snap remove lxd --purge

  # We would fail on restore of test suite anyway, but make it more explicit. 
  if test -d /var/snap/lxd/common; then
    echo "lxd snap wasn't fully removed"
    exit 1
  fi
