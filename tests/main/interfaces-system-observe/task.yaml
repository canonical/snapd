summary: Ensures that the system-observe interface works.

details: |
    A snap declaring the system-observe plug is defined, its command
    just calls ps -ax.

    The test itself checks for the lack of autoconnect and then tries
    to execute the snap command with the plug connected (it must succeed)
    and disconnected (it must fail).

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring a plug on the system-observe interface is installed"
    snapbuild $TESTSLIB/snaps/system-observe-consumer .
    snap install --dangerous system-observe-consumer_1.0_all.snap

restore: |
    rm -f system-observe-consumer_1.0_all.snap

execute: |
    CONNECTED_PATTERN=":system-observe +system-observe-consumer"
    DISCONNECTED_PATTERN="(?s).*?\n- +system-observe-consumer:system-observe"

    echo "Then the plug is shown as disconnected"
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$DISCONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "==========================================="

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect system-observe-consumer:system-observe
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$CONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "Then the snap is able to get system information"
    expected="(?s)/dev/tty.*?serial"
    su -l -c "system-observe-consumer" test | grep -Pq "$expected"

    echo "==========================================="

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect system-observe-consumer:system-observe
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$DISCONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "Then the snap is not able to get system information"
    if su -l -c "system-observe-consumer" test; then
        echo "Expected error with plug disconnected"
        exit 1
