  to change file attributes. For that a toggle binary is compiled and
  used to change the immutability attributes of a file.

# ubuntu-core doesn't have go :-)
# ppc64el disabled because of https://github.com/snapcore/snapd/issues/2503
systems: [-ubuntu-core-*, -ubuntu-*-ppc64el]

prepare: |
  go build -o toggle ./toggle.go

execute: |
  touch foo
  # no immutable flag:
  lsattr foo | NOMATCH i
  test "$(./toggle foo)" = "mutable -> immutable"
  # and now an immutable flag!:
  lsattr foo | MATCH i
  test "$(./toggle foo)" = "immutable -> mutable"
  # no immutable flag again:
  lsattr foo | NOMATCH i
