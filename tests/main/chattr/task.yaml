    # an empty $topsrcdir/tests/go.mod seems to break importing or building go
    # packages referenced by their import paths while under the tests directory,
    # need to disable go modules supportfor this test

prepare: |
  go build -o toggle ./toggle.go

execute: |

  test "$(./toggle foo)" = "mutable -> immutable"
  # and now an immutable flag!:
  lsattr foo | MATCH i
  test "$(./toggle foo)" = "immutable -> mutable"
  # no immutable flag again:
