summary: ensure only approved snaps can use snap-scoped system user

details: |
    Snapd has limited capability to create a non-root accounts, so that certain
    services that would normally run as root, perform initial configuration as
    root but then drop to a less privileged user.

    Some of the user names are special, in that they are allowed to be used only
    by specific snap IDs. The test checks that microk8s, azureiotedge, and
    azuredeviceupdate user names can be used with their corresponding snap IDs.

# - not running on 14.04 as we have no real systemd here
# - also exclude centos 7 because of old libseccomp (the
#   system-usernames test is already checking which distributions have the
#   needed support, so there's no need to replicate that code here)
systems: [-ubuntu-14.04-*]
