summary: Checks that removing the base directory of a tried snap works.

details: |
    The snap try command can be used to install a snap without creating the
    squashfs file, which for large snaps is very costly. The test shows that
    even if the directory holding try-mode snap's files is removed, snapd does
    not malfunction but instead shows the snap as in "broken" state.

systems: [-ubuntu-core-*]

execute: |
    echo "Given a tried snap"
    base_dir=$(mktemp -d)
    chmod 0755 "$base_dir"
    cp -a "$TESTSLIB"/snaps/test-snapd-tools/* "$base_dir"
    snap try "$base_dir"

    echo "Then it is listed as installed"
    snap list | grep -Pq "^test-snapd-tools +.*?try"

    echo "When its base directory is removed"
    rm -rf "$base_dir"

    echo "Then the snap is listed as a broken install"
    snap list | grep -Pq "^test-snapd-tools +.*?broken"
