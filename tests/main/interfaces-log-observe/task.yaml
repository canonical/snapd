summary: Check that the log-observe interface works.

details: |
    The log-observe interface allows a snap to read system logs and set kernel
    log rate-limiting.

    A snap which defines the log-observe plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

environment:
    SNAP_NAME: log-observe-consumer
    SNAP_FILE: "${SNAP_NAME}_1.0_all.snap"
    PLUG: log-observe

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap declaring the $PLUG plug is installed"
    snapbuild $TESTSLIB/snaps/$SNAP_NAME .
    snap install --dangerous $SNAP_FILE

restore: |
    rm -f $SNAP_FILE

execute: |
    CONNECTED_PATTERN="(?s)Slot +Plug\n\
    .*?\n\
    :$PLUG +$SNAP_NAME"
    DISCONNECTED_PATTERN="(?s)Slot +Plug\n\
    .*?\n\
    - +$SNAP_NAME:$PLUG"

    echo "Then the snap is not listed as connected"
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$DISCONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "============================================"

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect $SNAP_NAME:$PLUG
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$CONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "Then the plug can be disconnected again"
    snap disconnect $SNAP_NAME:$PLUG
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$DISCONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "============================================"

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect $SNAP_NAME:$PLUG
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$CONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "Then the snap is able to access the system logs"
    log-observe-consumer | grep -Pqz "ok\n"

    echo "============================================"

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect $SNAP_NAME:$PLUG
    snap interfaces | grep -Pzq "$DISCONNECTED_PATTERN"

    echo "Then snap can't access the system logs"
    if log-observe-consumer; then
        echo "System log shouldn't be accessible"
        exit 1
