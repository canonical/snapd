summary: Check that the log-observe interface works.

details: |
    The log-observe interface allows a snap to read system logs and set kernel
    log rate-limiting.

    A snap which defines the log-observe plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

environment:
    SNAP_NAME: log-observe-consumer
    PLUG: log-observe

prepare: |
    #shellcheck source=tests/lib/snaps.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB/snaps.sh"

    echo "Given a snap declaring the $PLUG plug is installed"
    install_local log-observe-consumer

execute: |
    echo "The interface is not connected by default"
    snap interfaces -i log-observe | MATCH "^- +$SNAP_NAME:$PLUG"

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect "$SNAP_NAME:$PLUG"

    echo "Then the plug can be disconnected again"
    snap disconnect "$SNAP_NAME:$PLUG"

    echo "When the plug is connected"
    snap connect "$SNAP_NAME:$PLUG"

    echo "Then the snap is able to access the system logs"
    log-observe-consumer | MATCH 'ok$'

    if [ "$(snap debug confinement)" = partial ] ; then
        exit 0
    fi

    echo "When the plug is disconnected"
    snap disconnect "$SNAP_NAME:$PLUG"

    echo "Then snap can't access the system logs"
    if log-observe-consumer; then
        echo "System log shouldn't be accessible"
        exit 1
    fi
