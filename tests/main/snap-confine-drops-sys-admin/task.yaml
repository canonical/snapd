summary: ensure that snap-confine drops CAP_SYS_ADMIN for non-root

details: |
    snap-confine must drop CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability when running from
    and only from a non-root user. This test verifies that fact. It
    also verifies it when running through sudo.

# This test is not executed on a core system simply because of the hassle of
# building the support C program. In the future it might be improved with the
# use of the classic snap where we just use classic to build the helper.
# Arch, CentOS, AMZN2, openSUSE do not have a static version of libcap.
# Ubuntu 14.04 does not have a proper session setup.
