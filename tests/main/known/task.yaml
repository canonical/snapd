summary: Check snap known

details: |
    The "snap known" command can be used to display assertions that snapd knows
    about. The command supports filtering by attribute value, to limit the
    display to a subset of assertion types or assertions with particular
    properties in general.

execute: |
    echo "Listing all account assertions"
    snap known account|MATCH "^type: account$"
    snap known account|MATCH "^account-id: canonical$"

    echo "Finding one account assertion with filters"
    cnt=$(snap known account account-id=canonical|grep -c "^type: account$")
    [ "$cnt" -eq 1 ]
    snap known account|MATCH "^account-id: canonical$"
    snap known account|MATCH "^username: canonical$"

    echo "Searching non existing assertion"
    cnt=$(snap known account account-id=non-existing|grep -c "^type: account$" || true)
    [ "$cnt" -eq 0 ]
