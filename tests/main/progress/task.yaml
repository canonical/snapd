summary: Verify progress reporting from snap command

details: |
  Verify that progress reporting from snap command works as expected depending
  on whether the command is ran with a tty attached or not.

systems:
  # no way to install socat
  - -ubuntu-core-*
  # observed to fail randomly?
  # TODO investigate once we can spin up instances in openstack manually
  - -fedora-*

prepare: |
  tests.pkgs install socat

execute: |
  echo "Minimal status reported when stdout is redirected"
  # no stdin, stdout to a pipe
  snap install test-snapd-tools-core24 </dev/null | tee -a non-tty-install.log
  snap remove test-snapd-tools-core24 </dev/null | tee -a non-tty-remove.log
  # a single summary line for both operations
  test "$(wc -l < non-tty-install.log)" = "1"

  # every status message as the client only displays a currently running task
  # and may have missed short lived tasks
