summary: Verify progress reporting from snap command

details: |
  Verify that progress reporting from snap command works as expected depending
  on whether the command is ran with a tty attached or not.

execute: |
  echo "Minimal status reported when stdout is redirected"
  # no stdin, stdout to a pipe
  snap install test-snapd-tools-core24 </dev/null | tee -a non-tty-install.log
  snap remove test-snapd-tools-core24 </dev/null | tee -a non-tty-remove.log
  # a single summary line for both operations
  test "$(wc -l < non-tty-install.log)" = "1"
  MATCH "test-snapd-tools-core24 .* installed" < non-tty-install.log
  test "$(wc -l < non-tty-remove.log)" = "1"
  MATCH "test-snapd-tools-core24 removed" < non-tty-remove.log

  echo "Rich status reporting when stdout is on a tty"

  # work around progress.go check for SPREAD_SYSTEM

  faketty snap install test-snapd-tools-core24 | tr '\r' '\n' > tty-install.log

  )
  # more than one line for each operation
  test "$(wc -l < tty-install.log)" -gt "1"
  test "$(wc -l < tty-remove.log)" -gt "1"
  # expecting multiple status messages and a summary, but we cannot check for
  # every status message as the client only displays a currently running task
  # and may have missed short lived tasks
  # XXX relax or drop this check if fails randomly
