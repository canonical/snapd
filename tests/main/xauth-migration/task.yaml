summary: Check file XAUTHORITY env variable points to is migrated into the snap environment

details: |
    The XAUTHORITY environment variable points to a file which is located
    in HOME, /run or /tmp depending on the distribution and desktop being
    used. If the file ends up in /tmp then it wont be visible inside the
    snap environment as each snap gets its private /tmp. To ensure the
    file XAUTHORITY points to is always available no matter where it is
    stored on the host system we migrate the file and copy it into
    /run/$USER/.Xauthority and set the XAUTHORITY environment variable
    accordingly.

    This test verified the correct behaviour of the implemented logic
    inside `snap run`.

execute: |
    snap install test-snapd-tools

    ensure_xauth_path() {
        export XAUTHORITY="$1"
        # Get rid of things to ensure a clean test bed
        rm -f /var/snap/test-snapd-tools/common/xauth-content /run/user/0/.Xauthority
        snap run --shell test-snapd-tools.sh <<'EOF'
    echo $XAUTHORITY > /var/snap/test-snapd-tools/common/xauth-content
    exit
    EOF
        env_path="$(cat /var/snap/test-snapd-tools/common/xauth-content)"
        test "$env_path" = "$2" || exit 1
        test "$(sh256sum $env_path)" = "$(sh256sum $1)"
        unset XAUTHORITY
    }

    mock_xauthority() {
        # Generate valid Xauthority file which `snap run` will accept
        rm -f $1; touch $1
        for ((c=0; c<=$2; c++))
        do
            # Family
            echo -n -e \\x01\\x00 >> $1
            # Address
            echo -n -e \\x00\\x04\\x73\\x6e\\x61\\x70 >> $1

        mkdir -p /run/user/0
        chmod 700 /run/user/0

    # An invalid Xauthority file should cause the XAUTHORITY
    # environment variable to stay untouched.

    # Generate valid Xauthority file which `snap run` will accept
    mock_xauthority /tmp/valid-xauthority 4
    chmod 600 /tmp/valid-xauthority

    # Xauthority should be correctly migrated
    ensure_xauth_path /tmp/valid-xauthority /run/user/0/.Xauthority
    test -e /run/user/0/.Xauthority

    # When we switch the owner the input xauth file shouldn't be moved.
    chown 1000:1000 /tmp/valid-xauthority
    ensure_xauth_path /tmp/valid-xauthority /tmp/valid-xauthority
    test ! -e /run/user/0/.Xauthority

    # We should not be able to get things like /etc/shadow migrated
    # into the snap environment. When `snap run` does the migration
    # it will change the content of the XAUTHORITY env variable
    # inside the snap environment and otherwise leave the variable
    # untouched. This is why the expected content of the XAUTHORITY
    # env variable in this case is /etc/shadow
    ensure_xauth_path /etc/shadow /etc/shadow
    test ! -e /run/user/0/.Xauthority
