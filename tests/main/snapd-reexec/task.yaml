summary: Test that snapd reexecs itself into core/snapd

details: |
    This test ensures that snapd and the snap cli reexecs themselves into the
    core/snapd snap under the right conditions. This includes ensuring that snapd
    reexecs itself when SNAP_REEXEC is set, that it does not reexec into older
    versions of snapd, and that it does not reexec when SNAP_REEXEC is set to 0.

    The test also ensures that snapd restarts itself when the core/snapd snap is
    refreshed, and that the right snapd is running after the refresh.

# Disable for Fedora, openSUSE and Arch as re-exec is not support there yet
systems: [-ubuntu-core-*, -fedora-*, -opensuse-*, -arch-*, -amazon-*, -centos-*]

environment:
