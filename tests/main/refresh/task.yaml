summary: Check that the refresh command works.

details: |
  In order to control the state of the available snaps a fake store
  is used in these tests. The store service is controlled by systemd
  and the snap versions are made directly available on its blob
  directory

prepare: |
  echo "Given a controlled store service is up"

  echo "And snapd is configured to use the controlled store"

  echo "And a snap is installed"


restore: |


execute: |
    echo "When a new version of that snap put in the controlled store"

    echo "Then the new version is available for the snap to be refreshed"
