summary: Check that we can remove core snap on classic systems.

details: |
    This test checks that we can remove core snap on classic systems, as long as
    snapd is installed as a snap. Classic systems do not have 'base' set in
    their model. On UC systems, that would be interpreted as 'core' being the
    base. On classic (non-hybrid) systems, that should be interpreted as there
    not being a base required.

    If snapd is not installed as a snap, then we can't remove the core snap
    since it might be providing snapd.

systems: [ubuntu-22.04-64]

execute: |
    # ensure snapd snap is installed
    snap list snapd
    # and so is the core snap
    snap list core

    # we should be able to remove the core snap, since the snapd snap is
    # installed.
    snap remove core

    # there should be no more snaps, so we can remove snapd
    snap remove snapd

    # TODO the 'old' snapd keeps running, this should be fixed in snapd snap
    systemctl restart snapd

    # now install core
    snap install --dangerous "$TESTSTMP"/core_snap/core_*.snap

    # we should be not able to remove the core snap, since only core snap is
    # installed now
    not snap remove core
