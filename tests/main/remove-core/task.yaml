summary: Check that we can remove core snap on classic systems.

details: |
    This test checks that we can remove core snap on classic systems, as long as
    snapd is installed as a snap. Classic systems do not have 'base' set in
    their model. On UC systems, that would be interpreted as 'core' being the
    base. On classic (non-hybrid) systems, that should be interpreted as there
    not being a base required.

    If snapd is not installed as a snap, then we can't remove the core snap
    since it might be providing snapd.

systems: [ubuntu-22.04-64]

execute: |
    # we should not be able to remove the core snap, since the snapd snap is not
    # installed.
    not snap remove core

    # make sure that the model does not have 'base' set
    snap model --assertion | NOMATCH 'base:'

    # enable transitioning to the snapd snap
    snap set core experimental.snapd-snap=true
    snap debug ensure-state-soon
    retry -n 30 snap watch --last=transition-to-snapd-snap
    snap list snapd

    # now remove the core snap, since we know that it isn't providing snapd
    # anymore. this, in addition to this being a classic system, should allow us
    # to remove the core snap.
    snap remove core
