summary: Ensure that the basic devpts security rules are in place.

details: |
    Test that a snap which has a plug for the physical-memory-observe interface
    can read /dev/pts, can openpty, and can access the PTY via /dev/ptmx, both
    with and without the physical-memory-observe interface connected.
