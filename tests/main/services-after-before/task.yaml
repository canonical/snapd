summary: Check that snap after/before ordering works

details: |
    Snap services of the same snap can be configured to follow an specific
    order on how those are launched. 

    This test verifies that the services defined in the test-snapd-after-before-service
    snap are started following the defined order by defining the before and after options.

execute: |
    echo "When the service snap is installed"

    # we are using systemd-notify indicate the service is active, this is
    # currently not allowed by daemon-notify interface, so we may as well just
    # install in devmode

    echo "We can see all services running"
    for service in before-middle middle after-middle; do
        systemctl status snap.test-snapd-after-before-service.$service | MATCH "running"
    done
