summary: Ensure bluez interface works.

details: |
    The bluez interface allows the bluez service to run and clients to
    communicate with it.

    This test verifies that the bluez snap from the store installs and
    we can connect its slot and plug.

    if ! snap list --unicode=never bluez &> /dev/null ; then
        echo "Installing bluez snap from the store ..."
        expected="(?s)bluez .* from Canonical\\* installed\\n"
        snap install bluez | grep -Pzq "$expected"
