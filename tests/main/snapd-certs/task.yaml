summary: Ensure that store ssl certs for snapd work

details: |
    Verify that we can set, get and unset SSL certs for the snap store. These
    operations are done via setting config options on the core snap.

    Additionally, we check that configuration options that are set on a revision
    of a snap are reverted if the snap is reverted to a previous revision. Note
    that the certificate is not removed in this case.

systems: [ubuntu-1*, ubuntu-2*]

environment:
    CERT: /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
    # uploading the core snap triggers OOM
    SNAPD_NO_MEMORY_LIMIT: 1

        echo "should have failed to set cert option to something that's not a PEM encoded cert"

    if snap set system store-certs.bad-cert=hello-there-not-a-cert; then
        echo "should have failed to set cert option to something that's not a PEM encoded cert"
