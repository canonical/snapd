summary: verify access to systemd credentials

details: |
    Systemd has introduced a feature where services can be provisioned with
    credentials that are stored in manner safer than typical default and where said
    credentials can be injected into the system (virtual machine, container or even
    physical machine) during provisioning or first boot.

    Snapd supports this for snaps on ubuntu-core with core24 boot base or where
    systemd on the host is recent enough and the application snap uses core24 base.

    This test shows how such credentials are provisioned and how they can be
    accessed. Note that credentials are only available to systemd services.

systems:
    - ubuntu-core-24-64
    - ubuntu-24.04-64
