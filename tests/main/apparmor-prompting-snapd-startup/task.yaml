summary: Check that snapd successfully starts with AppArmor prompting enabled

details: |
    When snapd starts up with the AppArmor prompting flag enabled, it attempts
    to load any existing rules from disk and records notices for them, expiring
    any rules which have expiration timestamps in the past. This test checks
    that snapd can successfully start with prompting enabled, and that it can
    load and expire rules and record notices appropriately.

systems:
  - ubuntu-2*

    # prerequisite for having a prompt handler service
