summary: Ensure that the cups interfaces work with app providers

details: |
    A snap providing the cups-control and cups interfaces should be able to
    create the control socket, with connecting consuming snaps able to use it.
    This intentionally does not test the mediation properties of the cupsd
    server.

# we run on all systems, since we want the cups snap to work for all systems
# which use snapd, such that any snap desiring to print can declare the cups
# interface and have it auto-connected to the cups snap on all systems for the
# best user experience everywhere

systems:
    # TODO: change the bases such that we can have 32-bit support again
    - -ubuntu-18.04-32
    # TODO: make the snap test-snapd-cups-consumer work well for arm64
    # currently producing error: 'nc: unix connect failed: No such file or directory'
    - -ubuntu-2*-arm-64
    - -ubuntu-core-2*-arm-64

    # install the test snaps

    # source for this snap:
    # https://github.com/anonymouse64/test-snapd-cups-consumer
    # needs to be built with snapcraft and hence cannot be snap pack'd here
    snap install --edge test-snapd-cups-consumer

    # the provider snap needs an assertion in order to have it's slot connected,
    # but since this PR has not yet landed, we simply use the store as a way to
    # download the built artifact - when this is fully supported in the
    # review-tools, etc. then this can install the provider from the store
    # directly instead
