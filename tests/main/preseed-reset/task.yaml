summary: Check that preseeded chroot can be re-set.

details: |
  This test checks that preseeding of Ubuntu cloud images with snap-preseed
  can be undone with --reset flag.

systems: [ubuntu-2*]

environment:
  IMAGE_MOUNTPOINT: /mnt/cloudimg

prepare: |

  # a cloud image url matching current $SPREAD_SYSTEM.
