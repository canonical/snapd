summary: Ensure that the serial-port interface works.

summary: |
    The serial-port interface allows a snap to access a serial device.

    This tests is different from the rest of interface tests in the sense that
    the serial-port interface is not provided by default by the os snap, it must
    be provided by a snap declaring a slot with the path of an existing serial
    device file.

    Moreover, given that the security profiles depend on the device path, they are
    created upon ìnstallation of the plug declaring snap. The test takes care of
    checking for its creation.

    The basic serial port functionality is also checked, in addition to the usual
    plug connect/disconnect tests.
