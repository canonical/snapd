summary: Ensure that the serial-port interface works.

summary: |
    The serial-port interface allows a snap to access a serial device.

    This tests is different from the rest of interface tests in the sense that
    the serial-port interface is not provided by default by the os snap, it must
    be provided by a snap declaring a slot with the path of an existing serial
    device.

    Moreover, given that the security profiles depend on the device path, they are
    created upon Ã¬nstallation of the slot provider snap. The test takes care of
    checking for its creation.

    The basic serial port functionality is also checked, in addition to the usual
    plug connect/disconnect tests.
