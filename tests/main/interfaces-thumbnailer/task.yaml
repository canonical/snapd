summary: Ensure that the thumbnailer interface works.

systems: [-ubuntu-core-16-64]

details: |
    The thumbnailer interface allows a snap to access the thumbnailer service.

    A snap which defines the thumbnailer plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to talk to the thumbnailer service
    via D-Bus.
    The test snap used calls a D-Bus method of the thumbnailer service.
    The test checks that the method calls returns successfully.
