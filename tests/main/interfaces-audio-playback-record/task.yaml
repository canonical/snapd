summary: Ensure that the audio-playback/record interface works

details: |
    Historically snapd offered the pulseaudio interface which allowed both
    playback and recording capabilities. Over time those were split into the
    audio-playback and audio-record interfaces, that grant the same permission
    to interact with pulseaudio APIs, but rely on an additional patch present in
    Ubuntu, which checks for the interface connection before allowing recording
    to take place.

    The patch is in debian/patches/0700-modules-add-snappy-policy-module.patch
    in the source package of pulseaudio in the Ubuntu archive.

    The test exercises that both audio playback and recording are really governed
    by the interface connection.

# Only classic Ubuntu has the pulseaudio mediation patches. Ubuntu 14.04 is unsupported on the desktop.
# TODO: extend tests.session and run this test on 14.04 as well.
