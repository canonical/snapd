summary: Check that `snapctl` can be run from the snap

details: |
    This test verifies that `snapctl` can be run from snap applications. When
    running `snapctl` from an app, the caller must provide a cookie to
    authenticate the request. This test also verifies that the cookie file is
    created with the correct permissions, and follows the expected lifecycle
    when installing, refreshing, and removing snaps.

environment:
    SNAP/nobase: snapctl-from-snap
    SNAP/wcore18: snapctl-from-snap-core18
