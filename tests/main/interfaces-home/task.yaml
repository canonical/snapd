summary: Ensure that the home interface works.

systems: [-debian-*]

details: |
    The home interface allows a snap to access non-hidden files in $HOME

    A snap which defines the home plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install for classic systems and disconnected
    on all-snaps and, as usual, must be able to be reconnected. When connected
    it must grant access to non hidden home files.

environment:
    SNAP_FILE: "home-consumer_1.0_all.snap"
    CREATABLE_FILE: "$HOME/creatable"
    READABLE_FILE: "$HOME/readable"
    WRITABLE_FILE: "$HOME/writable"
    HIDDEN_CREATABLE_FILE: "$HOME/.creatable"
    HIDDEN_READABLE_FILE: "$HOME/.readable"
