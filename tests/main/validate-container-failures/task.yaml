summary: check the container validator logs on error

details: |
    Snapd contains logic to validate the contents of the squashfs and ensure
    that files are readable and that application entry points are executable.
    The test mounts a snap with violates those rules to test that snapd detects
    and reports the problems accurately.

environment:
    SNAP: test-snapd-validate-container-failures

prepare: |
    # git doesn't preserve permissions properly :-(
    # sets up all the permissions, so I don't have to remember which
    # ones it does preserve (it basically mangles everything anyway)
    chmod 0600 "$SNAP/comp.sh"
    chmod 0644 "$SNAP/bin/bar"
    chmod 0700 "$SNAP/bin/foo"
    chmod 0    "$SNAP/meta/unreadable"
    chmod 0644 "$SNAP/meta/hooks/what"
