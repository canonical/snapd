    # FIXME: any time we manipulate the journal on core16 systems, with the
    # systemd version used there, systemd-journald closes the pipes it uses to
    # communicate with services, resulting in SIGPIPE. This also means that
    # snapd is killed with SIGPIPE and restarts on failure, due to the
    # configuration specified in snapd.service. Other services may not be so
    # lucky and just decide to die and stay dead.
    #
    # This is bug upstream bug https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84923
    #
    # It has been fixed in the version of systemd on core18+ but core16 makes
    # configuring the journal entirely unreliable as it leaves us with the
    # following alternatives:
    #
    # 1) Die in the middle of the hook, because journal is restarting.
    #    We can polish this so that snapd can die "cleanly", with enough
    #    effort, perhaps.
    #
    # 2) Ignore SIGPIPE and not log anything from snapd following the restart.
    #
    # Note that this also affects *all* services on the system, not just snapd.
