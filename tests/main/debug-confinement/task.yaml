summary: Verify confinement is correctly reported

details: |
    The confinement command will print the confinement mode (strict,
    partial or none) the system operates in. 

    This test verifies the `snap debug confinement` command it strict in
    ubuntu classic and core systems and it is partial in the rest.

execute: |
    expected=partial
    case "$SPREAD_SYSTEM" in
    ubuntu-*)
        expected=strict
        ;;
    *)
        ;;
    esac
    test "$(snap debug confinement)" = "$expected"
