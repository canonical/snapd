summary: trivial snap with classic confinement runs correctly

# Classic confinement isn't working yet on Fedora
systems: [-ubuntu-core-16-*]

details: |
    This test checks that a very much trivial "hello-world"-like snap using
    classic confinement can be executed correctly. There are two variants of
    this test (classic and jailmode) and the snap (this particular one) should
    function correctly in both cases.

execute: |

    snap install --classic test-snapd-hello-classic
    $SNAP_MOUNT_DIR/bin/test-snapd-hello-classic | MATCH 'Hello Classic!'

    TMPDIR=/tmpdir $SNAP_MOUNT_DIR/bin/test-snapd-hello-classic t | MATCH TMPDIR=/tmpdir

    if [ "$(snap debug confinement)" = partial ]; then
        exit 0
    fi

    # Instal again and put the snap into jailmode
    snap remove test-snapd-hello-classic
    snap install --classic --jailmode test-snapd-hello-classic

    $SNAP_MOUNT_DIR/bin/test-snapd-hello-classic | MATCH 'Hello Classic!'

restore: |
    snap remove test-snapd-hello-classic
