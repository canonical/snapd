summary: trivial snap with classic confinement runs correctly

# Classic confinement isn't working yet on Fedora
systems: [-ubuntu-core-16-*]

details: |
    This test checks that a very much trivial "hello-world"-like snap using
    classic confinement can be executed correctly. There are two variants of
    this test (classic and jailmode) and the snap (this particular one) should
    function correctly in both cases.

prepare: |
    . $TESTSLIB/dirs.sh
    if [[ "$SPREAD_SYSTEM" == fedora-* ]]; then
        # although classic snaps do not work out of the box on fedora,
        # we still want to verify if the basics do work if the user
        # symlinks /snap to $SNAP_MOUNT_DIR themselves
        ln -sf $SNAP_MOUNT_DIR /snap
    fi

execute: |
    . $TESTSLIB/dirs.sh

    run_install() {
        make -C test-snapd-hello-classic clean
        make -C test-snapd-hello-classic
        snap install "$@" --dangerous ./test-snapd-hello-classic/test-snapd-hello-classic_0.1_*.snap
    }

    run_install --classic
    $SNAP_MOUNT_DIR/bin/test-snapd-hello-classic | MATCH 'Hello Classic!'

    TMPDIR=/tmpdir $SNAP_MOUNT_DIR/bin/test-snapd-hello-classic t | MATCH TMPDIR=/tmpdir

    if [ "$(snap debug confinement)" = partial ]; then
        exit 0
    fi

    # Installing again will increase revision and put the snap into jailmode
    run_install --classic --jailmode
    $SNAP_MOUNT_DIR/bin/test-snapd-hello-classic | MATCH 'Hello Classic!'

restore: |
    make -C test-snapd-hello-classic clean
    if [[ "$SPREAD_SYSTEM" == fedora-* ]]; then
        rm -f /snap
    fi
