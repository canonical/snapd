summary: trivial snap with classic confinement runs correctly

details: |
    This test checks that a very much trivial "hello-world"-like snap using
    classic confinement can be executed correctly. There are two variants of
    this test (classic and jailmode) and the snap (this particular one) should
    function correctly in both cases.
