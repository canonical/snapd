summary: trivial snap with classic confinement runs correctly
details: |
    This test checks that a very much trivial "hello-world"-like snap using
    classic confinement can be executed correctly. There are two variants of
    this test (classic and jailmode) and the snap (this particular one) should
    function correctly in both cases.

    /snap/bin/test-snapd-hello-classic | MATCH 'Hello Classic!'

    # FIXME jailmode doesn't work on debian type systems due to missing
    # confinement yet. This check will be replaced with proper detection
    # if confinement is supported on the platform we're running.
