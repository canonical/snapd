    Ensure snapd builds as a snap

# TODO: we don't need to build the snapd snap in this test on as many systems
# when we have a way to dynamically download the snapd snap that was built for a
# particular PR from github actions, in which case we can just download that and
# install it here to test the things that we need to test about the snapd snap

# effectively we can only build the snap using LXD + snapcraft on ubuntu systems
# due to various bugs with other distros and snapcraft and/or LXD
systems:
    # snapcraft is a classic snap, can't run on ubuntu-core
    - -ubuntu-core*
    # LXD doesn't work properly on amazon linux, fedora 31, opensuse, or debian
    # 9 to build the snap, it complains about fuse.snapfuse getting EPERM when
    # snaps are installed inside the LXD container that snapcraft creates
    - -amazon-linux*
    - -debian-*
    - -fedora-*
    - -opensuse-*
    # additionally on fedora 32 and 33, and arch linux which are all cgroupsv2
    # now, LXD does not work either, with the service failing to start up at all
    # when we install LXD
    - -arch-*
    # snapcraft does not support running on centos 7 due to errors with the
    # locale, see https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapcraft/+bug/1922140
    # a separate error occurs on centos 8, see https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapcraft/+bug/1922981
    - -centos-*
    # ubuntu-18.04-32: i386 is not supported by lxd
    # TODO: enable i386 by using lxd 3.0, currently snapcraft is failing to get the
    #       lxd image when it is trying to build snapd
    - -ubuntu-18.04-32
