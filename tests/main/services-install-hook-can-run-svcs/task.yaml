summary: Check that install hooks in snaps can start services

details: |
    Snapd hooks are programs that run in response to certain actions. 
    The install hook is executed before starting snap services (if it has any) and
    before the configure hook. The install hook is the place for one-time actions,
    such as an early initialisation of a resource when installed for the first time.

    This test verifies that the install hook can interact with (start and stop)
    a snap service.

environment:
  FLAGS/enableflag: --enable
  FLAGS/noflag: ""

execute: |
  # setup the install hook with the right flags
  sed ./test-snapd-install-hook-runs-svc/meta/hooks/install.in -e "s/%%FLAGS%%/$FLAGS/" > ./test-snapd-install-hook-runs-svc/meta/hooks/install

  chmod +x ./test-snapd-install-hook-runs-svc/meta/hooks/install

  echo "Verify that the snap installs"
  "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-install-hook-runs-svc

  echo "Verify that the snap service is still disabled"
  snap services | MATCH "test-snapd-install-hook-runs-svc\\.svc\\s+disabled\\s+inactive"

  echo "Verify that the snap service ran and did something during the install hook"
  MATCH snap-svc-did-this < /var/snap/test-snapd-install-hook-runs-svc/current/data
