summary: Check that snaps can use stop-timeout

details: |
     A service from a snap may define a stop command as well as a stop
     timeout. When stopping a service, if the stop command takes more
     time than the defined stop timeout, then the stop command will be
     stopped and the service killed. This test verifies that the stop
     timeout works correctly by running a stop command for longer than
     the timeout.

# this test is expected to fail once we run the tests for SELinux
# distros in Enforce mode
# systemd on 14.04 does not really honour TimeoutStopSec
systems: [-ubuntu-14*]
