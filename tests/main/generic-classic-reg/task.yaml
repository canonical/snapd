    Ensure device initialization registration works with the fallback
    generic/generic-classic model and we have a serial and can acquire
    a session macaroon.

    #shellcheck source=tests/lib/core-config.sh
    . "$TESTSLIB"/core-config.sh

    if snap model --verbose | NOMATCH "brand-id:\s* generic" ; then
       echo "Not a generic model. Skipping."

    snap model --serial --assertion | MATCH "authority-id: generic"
