summary: mimic test for the hole-poking code in snap-update-ns

details: |
    When snap-confine cannot create a mount point because of read-only
    filesystem it will use a "writable mimic" constructed out of tmpfs and a
    farm of bind mounts.  This test contains a mimic snap that has various
    kinds of elements that must be correctly handled by the mimic code.

environment:
    PLUG: test-snapd-content-mimic-plug:content
    SLOT: test-snapd-content-mimic-slot:content

prepare: |
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-content-mimic-plug
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local test-snapd-content-mimic-slot

execute: |
    # Before the content interface is connected we expect to see certain files
    # in the $SNAP directory. Those files represent various kinds of filesystem
    # entries that should be correctly replicated inside the mimic.
