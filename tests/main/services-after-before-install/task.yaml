summary: Check that snap install respects after/before ordering of services

details: |
    Snap services of the same snap can be configured to follow an specific
    order on how those are launched. 

    This test install many times the test-snapd-after-before-service snap and verifies that
    the services defined in it are started following the defined order by using the before
    and after service options.
