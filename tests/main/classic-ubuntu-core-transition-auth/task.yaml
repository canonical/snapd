summary: Ensure that the ubuntu-core -> core transition works with auth.json

# we never test on core because the transition can only happen on "classic"
# we disable on ppc64el because the downloads are very slow there
# Fedora, openSUSE and Arch are disabled at the moment as there is something
# fishy going on and the snapd service gets terminated during the process.
systems: [-ubuntu-core-*, -ubuntu-*-ppc64el, -fedora-*, -opensuse-*, -arch-*]

# autopkgtest run only a subset of tests that deals with the integration
# with the distro
backends: [-autopkgtest]
