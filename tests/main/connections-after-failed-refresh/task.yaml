summary: Test that connections are kept after failed refresh or snap try

details: |
  This test verifies that connections are kept after a failed refresh or snap try.

  The test installs a snap, connects its interfaces, and then tries to refresh
  that snap. The refresh of the snap is expected to fail, and the test verifies
  that the interfaces are still connected.

  The test then tries to "snap try" the snap, which is also expected to fail,
  and the test verifies that the interfaces are still connected.

  Finally, the test verifies that the network plug is not present since it's
  provided by the second revision of the snap (and it failed to install).
