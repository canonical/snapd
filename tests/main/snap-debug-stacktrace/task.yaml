summary: Ensure `snap debug stacktraces` command works

details: |
    The command `snap debug stacktraces` should properly report stack traces for
    the currently running snapd daemon. It should not be callable from
    a non-root user.

execute: |
  snap debug stacktraces | MATCH 'goroutine'
  snap debug stacktraces | MATCH 'github.com/snapcore/snapd/daemon'

  echo "Ensure that stacktrace is not available to non-root users"
  su - test /bin/sh -c "snap debug stacktraces 2>&1" | MATCH "error: access denied"
