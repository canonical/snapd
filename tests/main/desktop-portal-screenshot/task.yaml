summary: the desktop portal screenshot API works for snap applications

details: |
    The xdg-desktop-portal screenshot interface provides a way for
    confined applications to take screenshots with the consent of the
    user.

    While there is nothing preventing an X11 client from screenshot
    other apps or the entire screen, this is not possible with
    Wayland.  Instead, it is necessary to ask the compositor to take a
    screenshot.

    While the gnome-shell compositor offers a D-Bus API to make
    screenshots, it is not appropriate to expose to confined
    applications.  There is no user prompt, and it can be used to make
    the shell write to arbitrary paths.

    The xdg-desktop-portal service addresses this by providing an API
    that prompts the user and delivers the screenshot to the app
    securely via the document portal.
