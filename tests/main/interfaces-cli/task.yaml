summary: Check the interfaces command

details: |
    The "snap interfaces" command allows looking at plugs and slots in all the
    snaps on the system. The command provides different behavior when invoked
    with a snap name or with an interface name.

environment:
    SNAP_NAME: network-consumer
    PLUG: network

prepare: |
    echo "Given a snap with the $PLUG plug is installed"
    "$TESTSTOOLS"/snaps-state install-local "$SNAP_NAME"

execute: |
    expected="(?s)Slot +Plug\\n\
    :$PLUG .*$SNAP_NAME"

    echo "When the interfaces list is restricted by slot"
    echo "Then only the requested slots are shown"
    snap interfaces -i "$PLUG" | grep -Pzq "$expected"

    echo "When the interfaces list is restricted by slot and snap"
    echo "Then only the requested slots are shown"
    snap interfaces -i "$PLUG" "$SNAP_NAME" | grep -Pzq "$expected"

    echo "Implicit slots are exposed by a snap holding the nickname 'system'"
    echo "but for compatibility they can also be listed when asking for 'core'"
    snap interfaces -i network system | MATCH '^:network .*'
    snap interfaces -i network core | MATCH '^:network .*'
