summary: Ensure that commands run when their core provided interfaces are connected

details: |
    Install a test snap that plugs as many core provided interfaces as is
    possible and verify the command can run (ie, don't test the interface
    functionality itself). This will help catch things like AppArmor
    policy syntax errors, seccomp policy parsing, udev querying bugs, etc.

# memory issue inside the adt environment
backends: [-autopkgtest]

# Ideally we would run this everywhere, but on systems with full security
# support, it takes a while, which leads to travis timeouts. Limit to:
# - Ubuntu Core
# - Ubuntu classic
# - All Ubuntu autopkgtests
# - Debian sid amd64 VM
# - TODO: All Fedora systems (for classic-only; unrelated error elsewhere)
systems:
    - ubuntu-*
    - debian-*
