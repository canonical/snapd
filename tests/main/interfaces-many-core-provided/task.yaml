summary: Ensure that commands run when their core provided interfaces are connected

details: |
    Install a test snap that plugs as many core provided interfaces as is 
    possible and verify the command can run (ie, don't test the interface 
    functionality itself). This will help catch things like AppArmor 
    policy syntax errors, seccomp policy parsing, udev querying bugs, etc.

# Ideally we would run this everywhere, but on systems with full security
# support, it takes a while, which leads to travis timeouts. Limit to:
# - Ubuntu Core 16 amd64
# - Ubuntu classic 14.04 i386 VM
# - Ubuntu classic 16.04 amd64 VM
# - Ubuntu classic 18.04 amd64 VM
# - All Ubuntu autopkgtests
# - Debian sid amd64 VM
# - Debian 9 amd64 VM
# - TODO: All Fedora systems (for classic-only; unrelated error elsewhere)
