summary: Ensure auto-install based transition to snapd snap works.

details: |
    Ensure that we can transition classic systems to snapd snap
    with auto-install of snapd snap from snapd deb or snapd in core
    triggered by any snap install that is not of type os, base,
    kernel, gadget or snapd. This change was introduced in PR14173.

# Exclude Ubuntu Core systems - require proper remodeling
# Simplify test by limiting system to ubuntu 22.04 amd64
systems: [ubuntu-22.04-64]

environment:
    SNAPD_SRC/deb:  "deb"
    SNAPD_SRC/core: "core"

skip:
    - reason: This test needs snapd deb built from local
      if: tests.info is-snapd-from-archive

prepare: |    
    # Expect system preparation stage installed built snapd and core snaps.
    # Check this and remove all snaps to remove snapd.
    snap list core
    snap list snapd
    snap remove core
    snap remove snapd
    # at this point we expect to be running from the deb 
    systemctl restart snapd.service

    # Install deb + core before introduction of snapd auto-install
    # on classic systems.
