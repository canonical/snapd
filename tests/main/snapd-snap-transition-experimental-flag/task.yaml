summary: Ensure snapd-snap experimental flag based transition to snapd snap works.

details: |
    Ensure that we can transition classic systems from core snap
    to snapd snap using the snapd-snap experimental flag.

# Exclude Ubuntu Core systems - require proper remodeling
systems: [-ubuntu-core-*]

prepare: |
    # remove all snaps to remove snapd
    snap remove core
    # this is only possible when snapd is the only installed snap
    snap remove snapd
    # at this point we expect to be running from the distro package
    systemctl restart snapd.service

    # transition from core snap to snapd snap
    snap install --dangerous "$TESTSTMP"/core_snap/core_*.snap
execute: |
    echo "Enable the snapd snap experimental feature"
    snap set core experimental.snapd-snap=true

    for _ in $(seq 30); do
        snap debug ensure-state-soon
        if snap list snapd; then
            break
        fi
        sleep 6
    done
    snap list snapd
