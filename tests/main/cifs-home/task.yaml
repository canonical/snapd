summary: Test that snaps still work when /home is a CIFS mount

details: |
    Snapd now contains a feature where CIFS-mounted /home (or any sub-directory)
    initializes a workaround mode where all snaps gain minimal amount of network
    permissions sufficient for CIFS to operate.

# Limit the test to systems that have samba fairly new samba.
systems:
  - ubuntu-22.04-*
  - ubuntu-24.04-*
