summary: Ensure that the fuse-support interface works.

details: |
    The fuse-support interface allows a snap to manage FUSE file systems.

    A snap which defines the fuse-support plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to create a fuse filesystem
    in a writable zone. The fuse-consumer test snap creates a readable file with a known
    name and content in the mount point given to the command.
