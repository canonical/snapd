summary: Ensure that the fuse-support interface works.

details: |
    The fuse-support interface allows a snap to manage FUSE file systems.

    A snap which defines the fuse-support plug must be shown in the interfaces
    list. The plug must be auto-connected on install and, as usual, must be able
    to be reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to create a fuse
    filesystem in a writable zone. The fuse-consumer test snap creates a
    readable file with a known name and content in the mount point given to the
    command.
