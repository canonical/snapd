summary: Ensure that the security rules for private tmp are in place.

details: |
    This test verifies that when a snap creates a temporary file in /tmp,
    then that file is accessible from other calls of commands from the same
    snap and that file is not accessible by other snaps.

# ppc64el disabled because of https://bugs.launchpad.net/snappy/+bug/1655594
