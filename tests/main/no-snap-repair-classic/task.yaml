summary: Ensure that snap-repair does nothing on classic Ubuntu

details: |
  Snapd comes with a special, emergency "repair" system designed to be
  independent from the main body of snapd, and to allow fixing flaws that
  prevent snapd from working in the case of a catastrophic failure.

  The repair system is designed for Ubuntu Core systems, as a last line of
  defense against unexpected problems. On classic systems, with another package
  manager and interacting users, the repair system is not necessary.

  The test checks that the systemd timer responsible for running the repair
  program is not installed.

# snap-repair is not shipped on non-ubuntu, but we don't want to run on ubuntu
# core, there is a core specific test in the core suite
systems:
  - ubuntu-1*
  - ubuntu-2*

execute: |
  echo "Ensure snap-repair is disabled on classic"
  snapd.tool exec snap-repair 2>&1 | MATCH "cannot use snap-repair on a classic system"

  echo "Ensure the snap-repair timer is disabled too"
  systemctl list-timers | NOMATCH snapd.snap-repair.timer
