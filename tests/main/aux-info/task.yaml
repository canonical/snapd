summary: Test that snap aux info is correctly stored and returned by the snapd API

details: |
  When installing a snap, we should store some auxiliary information about that
  snap in /var/cache/snapd/aux. This test verifies that this is properly done,
  and then verifies that the information is returned by the snapd API.
