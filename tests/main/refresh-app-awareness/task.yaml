summary: Ensure that foreground applications block app refresh.
# Ubuntu 14.04's special version of systemd doesn't have StartTransientUnit API.
systems: [-ubuntu-14.04-*]
details: |
    When the refresh-app-awareness feature is enabled running snap processes,
    mainly foreground applications, will block the refresh of said snap.
