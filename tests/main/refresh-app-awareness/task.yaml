summary: Ensure that foreground applications block app refresh.
details: |
    When the refresh-app-awareness feature is enabled running snap processes,
    mainly foreground applications, will block the refresh of said snap.
prepare: |
    # This feature depends on the release-app-awareness feature
    snap set core experimental.refresh-app-awareness=true
    snap pack test-snapd-refresh.v1
    snap pack test-snapd-refresh.v2
