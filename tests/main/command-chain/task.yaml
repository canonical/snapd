summary: Check that command-chain is properly supported

details: |
    Verify the command-chain feature works as expected for hooks, apps, and
    services. Rather than running the hook, app, or service directly, the
    command-chain should be prefixed to the target command. Additionally verify
    that the command-chain is executed when running a snap with `snap run
    --shell`.

systems:
  # uubuntu 32bit: test uses snap with base core20 which there is no 32bit
  # variant of
  - -ubuntu-*-32

environment:
    # Ensure that running purely from the deb (without re-exec) works
    # correctly
    SNAP_REEXEC/reexec0: 0
    SNAP_REEXEC/reexec1: 1
