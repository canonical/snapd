summary: Check that command-chain is properly supported

details: |
    Verify the command-chain feature works as expected for hooks, apps, and
    services. Rather than running the hook, app, or service directly, the
    command-chain should be prefixed to the target command. Additionally verify
    that the command-chain is executed when running a snap with `snap run
    --shell`.

environment:
    # Ensure that running purely from the deb (without re-exec) works
    # correctly
    SNAP_REEXEC/reexec0: 0
    SNAP_REEXEC/reexec1: 1
    BREADCRUMB: /var/snap/command-chain/current/breadcrumb
    ENVDUMP: /var/snap/command-chain/current/env

    snap logs command-chain | MATCH 'chain3 chain4 running: 0 0 1 1$'

    echo "Ensure that the command-chain is run with 'snap run --shell' as well"
    [ "$(snap run --shell command-chain.hello -c 'echo "shell"')" = "chain1 chain2 shell" ]
