summary: Ensure network interface works.

systems: [-fedora-*, -opensuse-*]

details: |
    The network interface allows a snap to access the network as a client.

    A snap which defines the network plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to access network services.

environment:
    SNAP_NAME: network-consumer
    PORT: 8081
    SERVICE_FILE: "./service.sh"
    SERVICE_NAME: "test-service"

prepare: |
    . "$TESTSLIB/snaps.sh"
    . $TESTSLIB/systemd.sh
    echo "Given a snap declaring the network plug is installed"
    install_local $SNAP_NAME

    echo "And a service is listening"
    printf "#!/bin/sh -e\nwhile true; do echo \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nok\n\" |  nc -l -p $PORT -q 1; done" > $SERVICE_FILE

    while ! netstat -lnt | grep -Pq "tcp.*?:$PORT +.*?LISTEN\n*"; do sleep 0.5; done
