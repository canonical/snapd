    The network interface allows a snap to access the network as a client.

    A snap which defines the network plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to access network services.

environment:
    SNAP_NAME: network-consumer
    PORT: 8081
    SERVICE_FILE: "./service.sh"
    SERVICE_NAME: "test-service"
