summary: Ensure network interface works.

details: |
    The network interface allows a snap to access the network as a client.

    A snap which defines the network plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to access network services.
