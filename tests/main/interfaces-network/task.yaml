summary: Ensure network interface works.

details: |
    The network interface allows a snap to access the network as a client.

    A snap which defines the network plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
    The plug must be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
    reconnected.

    A snap declaring a plug on this interface must be able to access network services.

environment:
    SNAP_NAME: network-consumer
    SNAP_FILE: ${SNAP_NAME}_1.0_all.snap
    PORT: 8081
    SERVICE_FILE: "./service.sh"
    SERVICE_NAME: "test-service"

prepare: |
    . $TESTSLIB/systemd.sh
    echo "Given a snap declaring the network plug is installed"
    snapbuild $TESTSLIB/snaps/$SNAP_NAME .
    snap install --dangerous $SNAP_FILE

    echo "And a service is listening"
    printf "#!/bin/sh -e\nwhile true; do echo \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nok\n\" |  nc -l -p $PORT -q 1; done" > $SERVICE_FILE
