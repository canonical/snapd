Generating audit.rules from rules located under /etc/audit/rules.d
------------------------------------------------------------------

The /etc/audit/audit.rules file can be generated using the augenrules(8)
executable. This action is performed automatically on each startup.

To disable it on a SysVinit system, edit /etc/default/auditd and set the
USE_AUGENRULES variable to "no".

On systemd based systems, you should create the following file with the
specified content and then call "systemctl daemon-reload":

  /etc/systemd/system/auditd.service.d/augenrules.conf:
    [Service]
    ExecStartPost=
    ExecStartPost=-/sbin/auditctl -R /etc/audit/audit.rules

Check that the needed rules are present in /etc/audit/audit.rules before
restarting the daemon.
