## This is for don't audit rules. We put these early because audit
### is a first match wins system. Uncomment the rules you want.

## Cron jobs fill the logs with stuff we normally don't want
#-a never,user -F subj_type=crond_t

## This prevents chrony from overwhelming the logs
#-a never,exit -F arch=x86_64 -S adjtimex -F auid=unset -F uid=chrony -F subj_type=chronyd_t

### This is not very interesting and wastes a lot of space if
### the server is public facing
#-a always,exclude -F msgtype=CRYPTO_KEY_USER
