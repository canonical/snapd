summary: |
  Ensure `snap validate --enforce --refresh` resolves validation set enforcement errors automatically.

details: |
  Check that snapd enforces validation sets, preventing snaps from being
  installed or removed if it would violate a constraint. Check that the
  `snap validate --refresh --enforce` command automatically resolves unmet
  validation set constraints except when it would require removing snaps.

environment:
  ACCOUNT_ID: test-snapd

restore: |
  snap validate --forget "$ACCOUNT_ID"/refresh-enforce-set-pinned-test || true
  snap validate --forget "$ACCOUNT_ID"/refresh-enforce-set-test || true

execute: |
  # pin a validation set, this should remained pinned once the other validation
  # set is enforced
  snap validate --refresh --enforce "$ACCOUNT_ID"/refresh-enforce-set-pinned-test=1

  echo "Check that --enforce --refresh installs required snaps"
  # TODO: test the auto-resolution for wrong revisions by installing revision 2
  # and checking it's moved to revision 1

  snap validate --refresh --enforce "$ACCOUNT_ID"/refresh-enforce-set-test

  # enforcing the new set should not have unpinned the previous set
  snap validate | MATCH "${ACCOUNT_ID}/refresh-enforce-set-pinned-test=1"

  # we can remove it now, as it is no longer needed
  snap validate --forget "$ACCOUNT_ID"/refresh-enforce-set-pinned-test
