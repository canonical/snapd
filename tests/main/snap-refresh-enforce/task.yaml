summary: |
  Ensure `snap validate --enforce --refresh` resolves validation set enforcement errors automatically.

details: |
  Check that snapd enforces validation sets, preventing snaps from being
  installed or removed if it would violate a constraint. Check that the
  `snap validate --refresh --enforce` command automatically resolves unmet
  validation set constraints except when it would require removing snaps.
