    Test that cloud-init is no longer vulnerable on Ubuntu Core with the fix for

    # ensured that the boot was okay in the device manager, but this will not
    # happen immediately in zero time, and moreover, snapd will not do anything
    # substantial or measurable until cloud-init has reached a steady state or
    # otherwise times out.

    # then wait a bit longer to give snapd a chance to run again and take 
    # action that we can test for. Since in this test, cloud-init was never 
    # used, the status command should not take much time at all, since it will 
    # not have been triggered.
