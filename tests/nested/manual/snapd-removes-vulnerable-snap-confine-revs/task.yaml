summary: Check that refreshing snapd to a fixed version removes vulnerable revs

details: |
  Check that having a vulnerable snapd installed, the refresh to a fixed version
  removes the vulnerabilities and the previous revision is removed.

# just focal is fine for this test - we only need to check that things happen on
# classic
systems: [ubuntu-2*]

environment:
  # which snap snapd comes from in this test
  SNAPD_SOURCE_SNAP/snapd: snapd

  # where we mount the image
  IMAGE_MOUNTPOINT: /mnt/cloudimg

  # we don't actually use snapd from the branch in the seed of the VM initially,
  # but we have to define this in order to get a custom image, see
  # nested_get_image_name in nested.sh for this logic
