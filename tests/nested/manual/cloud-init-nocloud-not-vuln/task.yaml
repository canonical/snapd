summary: |
    Test that cloud-init is no longer vulnerable on Ubuntu Core with the fix for
    CVE-2020-11933 in place with a system that used NoCloud configuration.

systems: [ubuntu-18.04-64, ubuntu-16.04-64]

environment:
    # this is for how nested.sh sets up the initial user, we will control
    # cloud-init for the test through -cdrom with users created through
    # system-user assertions to ensure that we are testing the right things
    NESTED_USE_CLOUD_INIT: false
    # this variant ensures that existing images without the fix are no longer
    # vulnerable after refreshing to a version of snapd with the fix
    NESTED_BUILD_FROM_CURRENT/refresh: false
    # this variant ensures that new images with the fix are not vulnerable
    NESTED_BUILD_FROM_CURRENT/firstboot: true
    NESTED_IMAGE_ID: cloud-init-nocloud-$NESTED_BUILD_FROM_CURRENT
