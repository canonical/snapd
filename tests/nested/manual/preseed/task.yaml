summary: Check that preseeded ubuntu cloud image boots.

details: |
  This test checks that preseeding of Ubuntu cloud images with snap-preseed
  command works, and the resulting image boots and finalizes seeding.
  The test assumes cloud image with a core and lxd snaps in its seeds/.

systems: [ubuntu-2*]

environment:
  IMAGE_MOUNTPOINT: /mnt/cloudimg

prepare: |
  #shellcheck source=tests/lib/preseed.sh
  . "$TESTSLIB/preseed.sh"

  # create a VM and mount a cloud image

  # on 20.04 snapd from the deb is newer than snapd from seeds;
  # this is not a sensible scenario for preseeding but since
  # we're cheating and preseeding images that were not meant to be
  # preseeded in their current state, we need to inject newer snapd
  # into seeds/ to make snap-preseed and the test happy.

  # add snapd from this branch into the seed
