summary: Check that preseeded ubuntu cloud image boots.

description: |
  This test checks that preseeding of Ubuntu cloud images with snap-preseed
  command works, and the resulting image boots and finalizes seeding.
  The test assumes cloud image with a core and lxd snaps in its seeds/.

systems: [ubuntu-19.10-*, ubuntu-2*]

environment:
  IMAGE_MOUNTPOINT: /mnt/cloudimg

  # into seeds/ to make snap-preseed and the test happy.
