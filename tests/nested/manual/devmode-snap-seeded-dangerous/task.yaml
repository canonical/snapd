summary: Check that devmode snaps can be seeded with a dangerous uc20 model

details: |
  Check that devmode snaps are seeded properly when using a dangerous model in
  Ubuntu Core. Verify that the devmode snap can be executed

# this is a UC20 specific test
systems: [ubuntu-20.04-64, ubuntu-22.04-64]

environment:
  NESTED_BUILD_SNAPD_FROM_CURRENT: true

prepare: |
  VERSION="$(tests.nested show version)"

  echo "Build a devmode snap to be included in the seed"
  snap pack "uc${VERSION}-devmode" --filename="$(tests.nested get extra-snaps-path)/devmode.snap"

  tests.nested build-image core
  tests.nested create-vm core

execute: |
  echo "Check that the devmode snap is installed"
  VERSION="$(tests.nested show version)"
  remote.exec "snap list test-snapd-devmode-core$VERSION"
  remote.exec "snap info --verbose test-snapd-devmode-core$VERSION" | MATCH "confinement:\s+devmode"
  remote.exec "snap info --verbose test-snapd-devmode-core$VERSION" | MATCH "devmode:\s+true"
  
  echo "Check that the devmode snap can be run"
  remote.exec "test-snapd-devmode-core$VERSION"
