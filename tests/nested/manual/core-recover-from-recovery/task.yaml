summary: Verify that we can boot with recovery keys after tpm was reset

details: |
    This test get recovery keys, powers off the machine, then clears
    the TPM. Then booting with the recovery keys, it should be
    possible to get the machine to work again.


# TODO: This test is intended to grow testing that the machine indeed
# used recovery keys, and that we can reprovision and reseal then
# reboot without recovery keys.
