summary: Verify that install-device with system-files works with specific device

details: |
    This test checks that the workaround put in place for a specific device
    continues to work. This specific device needs to install configuration files
    onto the run system ubuntu-data on UC20 during install mode to avoid an
    additional reboot during the first boot process.

systems: [ubuntu-20.04-64]
