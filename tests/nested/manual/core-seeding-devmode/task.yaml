summary: Test that devmode snaps can be installed during seeding.

# testing with core16 (no snapd snap) and core18 (with snapd snap) is enough

prepare: |
    # seed a devmode snap
    snap download --beta godd
    GODD_SNAP=$(ls godd_*.snap)
    mv "$GODD_SNAP" "$(tests.nested get extra-snaps-path)"

    tests.nested build-image core
    tests.nested create-vm core
