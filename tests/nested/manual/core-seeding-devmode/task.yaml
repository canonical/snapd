summary: Test that devmode snaps can be installed during seeding.

# testing with core16 (no snapd snap) and core18 (with snapd snap) is enough
systems: [ubuntu-16.04-64, ubuntu-18.04-64]

prepare: |
    # seed a devmode snap
    snap download --beta godd
    GODD_SNAP=$(ls godd_*.snap)
    mv "$GODD_SNAP" "$(tests.nested get extra-snaps-path)"

    tests.nested build-image core
    tests.nested create-vm core

execute: |
    remote.exec "sudo snap wait system seed.loaded"

    # godd is installed
    remote.exec "snap list godd" | MATCH "godd"
