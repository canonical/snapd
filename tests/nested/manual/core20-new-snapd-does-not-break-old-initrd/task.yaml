summary: verify that new snapd's do not break old snap-bootstrap/kernel initrds

details: |
  The snapd secure boot implementation is complex, and some of the elements that live in the
  snapd.git repository end up as a part of the signed kernel package's initrd
  file. This inadvertently allows a skew to occur, where a future snapd is booted with a past
  initrd.

  The test exercise the scenario where we start with stable kernel +
  stable snapd, then refresh to new snapd. We then trigger a reseal
  operation and reboot to make sure that the old snap-bootstrap/initrd
  in the stable kernel can still unlock the encrypted partitions.

  We do not cover the case where a kernel snap is too old for the
  snapd in the seed that was used to install Ubuntu Core.
