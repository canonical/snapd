summary: verify that new snapd's do not break old snap-bootstrap/kernel initrds

systems: [ubuntu-20.04-64]

# we have two variants here:
#
# 1. we start with stable kernel + stable snapd -> refresh to new snapd
# 2. we start with stable kernel + new snapd
#
# and then in both cases we then trigger a reseal operation and reboot to make
# sure that the old snap-bootstrap/initrd in the stable kernel can still unlock
# the encrypted partitions

environment:
  NESTED_CUSTOM_MODEL: $TESTSLIB/assertions/ubuntu-core-20-amd64.model

  # don't bundle the snapd snap via nested.sh's machinery, instead we will
  # side-load our snapd snap built from this branch into the image via
  # extra-snaps since we still want to use MS keys and such for this image, and
  # defining this to be true brings with it i.e. snakeoil keys in the OVMF
  # firmware for example
  NESTED_BUILD_SNAPD_FROM_CURRENT: false

  # we want snaps from the stable channel by default with the exception of the
  # snapd snap which we will conditionally repack as per NESTED_BUILD_SNAPD_FROM_CURRENT
