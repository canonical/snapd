summary: verify that new snapd's do not break old snap-bootstrap/kernel initrds

details: |
  The snapd secure boot implementation is complex, and some of the elements that live in the
  snapd.git repository end up as a part of the signed kernel package's initrd
  file. This allows a skew to occur, where future snapd is booted with past
  initrd.

  The test exercises two scenarios:
  
  1. We start with stable kernel + stable snapd -> refresh to new snapd
  2. We start with stable kernel + new snapd

  In both cases we then trigger a reseal operation and reboot to make sure that
  the old snap-bootstrap/initrd in the stable kernel can still unlock the
  encrypted partitions
