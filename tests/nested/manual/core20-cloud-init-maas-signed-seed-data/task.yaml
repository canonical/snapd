summary: Test that UC2* can use cloud-init config on ubuntu-seed with grade signed.

systems: [ubuntu-20.04-64, ubuntu-22.04-64]

environment:
  # three variants
  # one with gadget that says maas
  GADGET_DATASOURCE/gadgetsaysmaas: maas
  # one that says explicitly no datasource
  GADGET_DATASOURCE/gadgetsaysnone: explicitly-none
  # and one that has no opinion (like the default pc gadget)

  # for grade: secured but is just nice to have for proof of conception with
  # grade signed too
