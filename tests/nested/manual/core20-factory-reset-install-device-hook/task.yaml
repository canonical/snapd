summary: Verifies that we run the install-device hook in factory reset mode

details: |
    This test checks that the install-device hook is executed in factory-reset
    mode. It also checks that it is possible to differentiate between the two
    conditions (whether the hook is executed in install mode, or factory-reset
    mode ).
