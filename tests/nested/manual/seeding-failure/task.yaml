summary: test seeding where a non-essential snap fails to be installed

details: |
  This test ensures that seeding will gracefully handle the failed installation
  of a non-essential snap. Specifically, we undo tasks that install the
  non-essential snaps, but we leave the essential snaps installed. Seeding is
  retried until we are successful.

  This test orchestrates this by creating an application snap with a oneshot
  service. This service fails the first time it runs, but succeeds the second
  time. This is achieved using the system-files interface.
