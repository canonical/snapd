summary: Test that time moves forward when the RTC is broken/unavailable in UC20

systems: [ubuntu-2*]

environment:
  NESTED_BUILD_SNAPD_FROM_CURRENT: true
  NESTED_USE_CLOUD_INIT: true

  # disable the real time clock and effectively break it so it returns unix
  # epoch to simulate devices like the rpi which do not have RTC
  NESTED_PARAM_RTC: "-rtc base=1970-01-01,clock=vm"

  # this is the unix time timestamp we want the initramfs to use, 1 here is just
  # 1 second after the unix epoch
  NESTED_CORE20_INITRAMFS_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP: 1

  # this is one second before the model assertion timestamp, this should be
  # bumped if the model assertion is ever resigned with a newer timestamp in it,
  # but doesn't strictly need to be updated every time as long as the timestamp
  # increases monotonically the test is still valid
