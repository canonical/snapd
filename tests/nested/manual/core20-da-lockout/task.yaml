summary: Check that an unclean shutdown on UC20 devices works

details: |
    This test checks that an unclean shutdown of a UC20 device does
    not cause an eventual DA lockout (LP: 1979185)

systems: [ubuntu-2*]

environment:
  NESTED_ENABLE_TPM/encrypted: "true"
  NESTED_ENABLE_SECURE_BOOT/encrypted: "true"

prepare: |
    tests.nested build-image core
    tests.nested create-vm core

    go build ./getdalockout.go
    remote.push ./getdalockout

execute: |
    remote.exec "sudo snap wait system seed.loaded"
    remote.wait-for device-initialized

    # lockout value is zero initially
    remote.exec sudo ./getdalockout | MATCH "lockout counter value: 0"

    boot_id=$(tests.nested boot-id)
    remote.exec "sudo sync"
    # force an (external) reboot
    tests.nested vm unclean-reboot
    remote.wait-for reboot "${boot_id}"
    remote.wait-for snap-command

    # and is still zero after a unclean shutdown, it will happen in
    # secboot.MarkSuccessful so there is a race
    retry -n 10 --wait 2 sh -c 'remote.exec sudo ./getdalockout | MATCH "lockout counter value: 0"'
