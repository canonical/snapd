summary: verify a UC20 to UC22 remodel

# the test may be unstable as UC22 is effectively a work-in-progress thing, and
# the model in question uses latest/edge of core22 and 22/edge of pc and
# pc-kernel snaps

systems: [ubuntu-20.04-64]

# TODO: re-enable the test once lp:1979197 is fixed
manual: true

environment:

  # TODO: disable TPM for now and investigate why the system cannot be booted
  # after remodel completes
  NESTED_ENABLE_TPM: false
  NESTED_ENABLE_SECURE_BOOT: false
  # we need pc/pc-kernel/core20 from the store, such that they get properly
