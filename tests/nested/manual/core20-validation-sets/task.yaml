summary: Verify that validation-sets are working and correctly tracked after seeding

details: |
    Snapd offers a way to ensure a good set of snaps is installed in a given
    system, ensuring that refreshes move between one good set and another. This
    system is known as validation sets. The test verifies that a validation set
    is effective immediately after seeding.

systems: [ubuntu-20.04-64]
