summary: core revert test

details: |
    Older versions of snapd used to change the way seccomp profiles are handled, which could cause
    problems when future snapd was reverted to old snapd, causing old profiles to
    fail to parse and load. This was addressed with the introduction of a system
    key and eventually with the switch to pre-compiled seccomp profiles. This
    test uses a virtual machine to ensure, that the core snap can be safely
    reverted in case this is required for another reason.
