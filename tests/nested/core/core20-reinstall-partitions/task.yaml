summary: Run a smoke test on UC20 with encryption enabled

details: |
    This test checks that UC20 can be reinstalled

systems: [ubuntu-20.04-64]

environment:

    # shutdown to go into install mode, but before we actually reboot into the
    # install mode
    # these are disabled for now, since to do a reinstall we have to reset the
    # tpm too
