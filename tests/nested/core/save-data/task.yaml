summary: Run test to ensure snaps can store data on ubuntu-save partition

details: |
    This test verifies that a folder is created for newly installed snaps on the
    ubuntu-save partition. It then verifies that we can write data to that folder
    and that the folder is removed again once the snap is removed.

systems: [ubuntu-20.04-64, ubuntu-22.04-64]
