summary: Check that a after a revert of a boot snap connections are restored

details: |
  This test checks that after a revert that involved a boot snap (so we had
  two reboots, one for installing and one for reverting) in a transactional
  update, we still have connections to the base snap. It has been detected
  that this happens if one of the updated snaps is snapd.

# TODO: UC16/ubuntu-16.04-64 needs a different approach as it still uses core
systems: [ubuntu-18.04-64, ubuntu-20.04-64, ubuntu-22.04-64]
