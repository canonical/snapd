summary: Ensure that commands run when their core provided interfaces are connected

details: |
    Install a test snap that plugs as many core provided interfaces as is
    possible and verify the command can run (ie, don't test the interface
    functionality itself). This will help catch things like AppArmor
    policy syntax errors, seccomp policy parsing, udev querying bugs, etc.
