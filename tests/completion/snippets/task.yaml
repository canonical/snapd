summary: snippets completion?

details: |
  Snapd contains a special system for tab-completion of snap applications, where
  the bulk of the completion logic runs under confinement, and communicates with
  a trusted, unconfined helper provided by snapd.

  Like all the other completion tests, this test relies on a set of files
  $variant.{complete,sh,vars} where foo $variant is one of the many variants of
  the tests/complete suite: plain, plain_plusdirs, funky, files, hosts,
  hosts_n_dirs, func, funkyfunc, funcarg. In each case the .vars file adds
  environment variables needed by the test, the .sh script is executed during
  test setup and the .complete script replaces the bash completer in the
  test-snapd-complexion snap.

  Like all the other completion tests this test is mostly implemented with
  expect(1) to interact with bash, send and receive snippets of text.

  This test installs the snap test-snapd-complexion and uses expect(1) to check
  the intended behavior, while running as the test user. This test relies on the
  complete.sh/etelpmoc.sh pair of scripts to communicate across the barrier
  created by the snap execution sandbox.
