summary: Ensure the system handles properly a big number of core provided connections

details: |
    Install a test snap that plugs as many core provided interfaces as is
    possible and verify the command can run. This will help catch performance
    issues in snapd, AppArmor,seccomp policy parsing, etc.

environment:
    CONSUMER_SNAP: test-snapd-policy-app-consumer

    # If possible, prepare a session for the test user. On many systems this
    # will allow running all tests as the unprivileged user. This shields us
    # from accidentally triggering any additional processes from run in the
    # session of the root user and stay behind after this test terminates.
