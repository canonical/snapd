summary: |

  The log-observe interface allows a snap to read system logs and set kernel
  log rate-limiting.

  A snap which defines the log-observe plug must be shown in the interfaces list.
  The plug must not be autoconnected on install and, as usual, must be able to be
  reconnected.

  SNAP_NAME: log-observe-consumer
  SNAP_FILE: "./$[SNAP_NAME]_1.0_all.snap"
  PLUG: log-observe
