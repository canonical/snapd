summary: Ensure that the mount namespace a given layout
details: |
    This test analyzes /proc/self/mountinfo which contains a representation of
    the mount table of the current process. The mount table is a very sensitive
    part of the confinement design. This test measures the effective table,
    normalizes it (to remove some inherent randomness of certain identifiers
    and make it uniform regardless of particular names of block devices, snap
    revisions, etc.) and then compares it to a canned copy.

    There are several reference tables, one for core (aka all-snap system) and
    one for classic. At this time only classic systems are measured and tested.
    The classic systems are further divided into those using the core snap and
    those using the older ubuntu-core snap. Lastly, they are divided by
    architectures to take account any architecture specific differences.
