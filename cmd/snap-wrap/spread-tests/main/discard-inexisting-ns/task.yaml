summary: Check that snap-discard-ns gracefully handles errors
details: |
    The internal snap-discard-ns program is supposed to simply unmount
    whatever is mounted at /run/snapd/ns/$SNAP_NAME.mnt. In case of
    some specific failures though, we don't expect it to fail.
prepare: |
    umount /run/snapd/ns || true
    rm -rf /run/snapd/ns
execute: |
    echo "We can try to discard a namespace before *any* snap runs"
    /usr/lib/snapd/snap-discard-ns foo
    echo "We can try to discard a namespace before the .mnt file exits"
    mkdir -p /run/snapd/ns/
    /usr/lib/snapd/snap-discard-ns foo
    echo "We can try to discard a namespace before the .mnt file is mounted"
    touch /run/snapd/ns/foo.mnt
    /usr/lib/snapd/snap-discard-ns foo
restore: |
    rm /run/snapd/ns/foo.mnt
    rm /run/snapd/ns/foo.lock
    rmdir /run/snapd/ns
