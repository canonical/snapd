summary: mount namespace is shared among processes
details: |
    The mount namespace is automatically shared amongst processes belonging to
    a given snap. The namespace is preserved until the machine reboots or until
    it is discarded with snap-discard-ns.
prepare: |
    # NOTE: devmode is required because otherwise we cannot read /proc/self/ns/mnt
    snap install --devmode snapd-hacker-toolbelt

    export PATH=/snap/bin:$PATH
