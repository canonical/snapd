The disconnect command disconnects a plug from a slot.
It may be called in the following ways:

$ snap disconnect <snap>:<plug> <snap>:<slot>

Disconnects the specific plug from the specific slot.

$ snap disconnect <snap>:<slot or plug>

Disconnects everything from the provided plug or slot.
The snap name may be omitted for the core snap.

When an automatic connection is manually disconnected, its disconnected state
is retained after a snap refresh. The --forget flag can be added to the
disconnect command to reset this behaviour, and consequently re-enable
an automatic reconnection after a snap refresh.
