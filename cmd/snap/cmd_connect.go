The connect command connects a plug to a slot.
It may be called in the following ways:

$ snap connect <snap>:<plug> <snap>:<slot>

Connects the specific plug to the specific slot.

$ snap connect <snap>:<plug> <snap>

Connects the specific plug to the only slot in the provided snap that matches
the connected interface. If more than one potential slot exists, the command
fails.

$ snap connect <plug> <snap>[:<slot>]

Without a name for the snap offering the plug, the plug name is looked at in
the gadget snap, the kernel snap, and then the os snap, in that order. The
first of these snaps that has a matching plug name is used and the command
proceeds as above.
