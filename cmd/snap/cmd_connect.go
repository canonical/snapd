The connect command connects a plug to a slot.
It may be called in the following ways:

$ snap connect <snap>:<plug> <snap>:<slot>

Connects the provided plug to the given slot.

$ snap connect <snap>:<plug> <snap>

Connects the specific plug to the only slot in the provided snap that matches
the connected interface. If more than one potential slot exists, the command
fails.

$ snap connect <snap>:<plug>

Connects the provided plug to the slot in the core snap with a name matching
the plug name.
