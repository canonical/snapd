/** 
 * sc_apply_seccomp_profile_for_security_tag applies a seccomp profile to the
 * current process. The filter is loaded from a pre-compiled bpf bytecode
 * stored in "/var/lib/snap/seccomp/bpf" using the security tag and the
 * extension ".bin". All components along that path must be owned by root and
 * cannot be writable by UNIX _other_.
 *
 * The security tag is shared with other parts of snapd.
 * For applications it is the string "snap.${SNAP_INSTANCE_NAME}.${app}".
 * For hooks it is "snap.${SNAP_INSTANCE_NAME}.hook.{hook_name}".
 *
 * Profiles must be present in the file-system. If a profile is not present
 * then several attempts are made, each coupled with a sleep period. Up 3600
 * seconds may elapse before the function gives up. Unless
 * $SNAP_CONFINE_MAX_PROFILE_WAIT environment variable dictates otherwise, the
 * default wait time is 120 seconds.
 *
 * A profile may contain valid BPF program or the string "@unrestricted\n".  In
 * the former case the profile is applied to the current process using
 * sc_apply_seccomp_filter. In the latter case no action takes place.
 *
 * The return value indicates if the process uses confinement or runs under the
 * special non-confining "@unrestricted" profile.
