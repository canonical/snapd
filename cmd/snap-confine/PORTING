Welcome brave porters!

This file is intended to guide you towards porting snappy (comprised of snapd
and this project, snap-confine) to work on a new kernel. The confinement setup by
snap-confine has several requirements on the kernel.

TODO: list required patches (apparmor, seccomp)
TODO: list required kernel configufation
TODO: list minimum supported kernel version

While you are working on porting those patches to your kernel of choice, you
may configure snap-confine with --disable-security. This switch drops
requirement on apparmor, seccomp and udev and reduces snap-confine to arrange
the filesystem in a correct way for snaps to operate without really confining
them in any way.
