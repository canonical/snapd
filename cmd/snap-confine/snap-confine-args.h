/**
 * Parse command line arguments for snap-confine.
 *
 * Snap confine understands very specific arguments.
 *
 * The argument vector can begin with "ubuntu-core-launcher" (with an optional
 * path) which implies that the first arctual argument (argv[1]) is a copy of
 * argv[2] and can be discarded.
 *
 * The argument vector is scanned, left to right, to look for switches that
 * start with the minus sign ('-'). Recognized options are stored and
 * memorized. Unrecognized options return an appropriate error object.
 *
 * Currently only one option is understood, that is "--version". It is simply
 * scanned, memorized and discarded. The presence of this switch can be
 * retrieved with sc_args_is_version_query().
 *
 * After all the option switches are scanned it is expected to scan two more
 * arguments: the security tag and the name of the executable to run.  An error
 * object is returned when those is missing.
 *
 * Both argc and argv are modified so the caller can look at the first unparsed
 * argument at argc[0]. This is only done if argument parsing is successful.
