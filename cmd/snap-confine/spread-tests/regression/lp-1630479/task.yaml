details: |
    The PATH environment variable needs to make sense for the layout of the
    core snap. Snap-confine contains code that sets it accordingly but during
    the introduction of the namespace sharing feature that code would run only
    when the namespace was initially constructed. Subsequent calls would not
    see the correct path.
