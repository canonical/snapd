summary: Check that execle doesn't regress
# This is blacklisted on debian because we first have to get the dpkg-vendor patches
systems: [-debian-8]
details: |
 The setup for this test is unorthodox because by the time the cgroup code is
 executed, the mounts are in place and /lib/udev/snap-device-helper from the core
 snap is used. Unfortunately, simple bind mounts over
 /snap/ubuntu-core/current/lib/udev don't work and the core snap must be
 unpacked, lib/udev/snap-device-helper modified to be tested, repacked and mounted.
 We unmount the core snap and move it aside to avoid both the original and the
 updated core snap from being mounted on the same mount point, which confuses
 the kernel.
