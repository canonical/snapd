/**
 * Assuming a new mountspace, populate it accordingly.
 *
 * This function performs many internal tasks:
 * - prepares and chroots into the core snap (on classic systems)
 * - creates private /tmp
 * - creates private /dev/pts
 * - applies quirks for specific snaps (like LXD)
 * - processes mount profiles
 *
 * The function will also try to preserve the current working directory but if
 * this is impossible it will chdir to SC_VOID_DIR.
