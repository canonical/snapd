# Because it is not killed by the switch root, we have to make sure
# not to not depend on local-fs.target, sysinit.target,
# etc. so that `isolate initrd-switch-root.target` will still take
# down all those targets.
# We still need to run after basic.target but this will be already wanted
# by initrd.target
