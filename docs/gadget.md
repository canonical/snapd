# Gadget snappy package

The `gadget` snappy package is a snappy package `type` that is used to setup and
personalize the system.

It covers a broad range, such as the software stack with its configuration and
hardware enablement.

There can only be *one* snappy package of `type: gadget` and it can only be
installed during image provision.

## Nomenclature

Some parts of this text refer to pure snappy packages, and `device` or
`ubuntu-core` packages. The intent is that in the future, `device` and
`ubuntu-core` would migrate to being pure snappy packages in the future. This
has been generalized in some text with the concept of `parts`, in this writing
everything is a *package*.

## Customization entry points

### Default packages

The `gadget` snap can provide a set of default packages to be installed during
either provisioning or first boot. The former is interesting to IoT scenarios
while the latter is useful for cloud deployments (although `cloud-init`
directly also serves the purpose for pure clouds).

In the case of first boot provisioning, the data is just fed into cloud-init for
the appropriate actions to take place.

For the preinstalled case, the provisioning tool will download the package
selection from the store and provision onto the system.

### Snappy package configuration

Each snappy package can be configured independently or by feeding a full
configuration with all packages.

The `gadget` package shall initially support providing a `config.yaml` describing
each package that is to be configured.

On first boot of the system, this `config.yaml` file will be processed and the
described configuration will be applied. *Note:* factory resetting the system
will create a first boot scenario and therefore `config.yaml` will be
processed.

Some configuration entries are currently driven entirely by `cloud-init`,
these are fine for a cloud enabled instance of snappy, not so much for IoT.
The intent of the `ubuntu-core` package configuration is to wrap around
`cloud-init` and use it where possible and relevant.

### Store ID

If a non-default store is required, one may use the `store/id` entry and
`snappy` will use it to reach the appropriate store.

### Don't configure first ethernet device using ifup

By default snappy ubuntu core will try to bring up the first ethernet
device in the system using `ifup`. If this is not wanted (e.g. because
the network will be managed by one of the preinstalled snaps instead),
set `skip-ifup-provisioning` to `true`.

### Branding

Branding can be set in the form of a slogan. `snappy` and itâ€™s `webdm`
counterpart will use this information to brand the system accordingly.

### Hardware

#### dtb

The default dtb (device tree blob) can be overridden by a key entry point in
the `snap.yaml` for the `gadget`.

If a dtb is specified during provisioning, it will be selected as the dtb to
use for the system. If using an AB partition layout, when an update for the
`gadget` package is installed which updates the `dtb`, the update will be
installed to the *other* partition and a reboot will be requested.

An upgrade path must be calculated by `snappy` to determine the priority and
ordering for an `ubuntu-core` update and an `gadget` snap update.

#### Bootloaders

Since each system boots differently, assets that are currently provided in
`flashassets` of the device package can be provided in the `gadget` snap instead.
This is useful for systems that use the default `device` package (ie, one which
uses the officially supported Ubuntu kernel and initrd).

Examples of assets that may be provided via the `gadget` snap are `MLO`, `u-boot`,
`UEnv.txt` `script.bin` or anything external to the system that allows for a
system to boot.

While these assets are typically used during provisioning, they may also be
used against a running system. *Caution:* updating these assets on a running
system may lead to a broken system unless redundancy or fallback mechanisms
aren't provided by the Gadget.

#### Partition layout

In the current layout, the `device` package contains a file called
`hardware.yaml`, the `partition-layout` will be migrated to the `gadget` snappy
package to provide a more generic `device` package.

The only supported layout today is AB.

#### Hardware assign

Hardware can be assigned directly to a snap part in the gadget snap.
This is useful if you are building e.g. a fixed function device.
The "assign" key is used and it takes a list of snap parts as parameter
that will then get access to the devices specified by the "rules"
section. The matching is flexible and follows what the kernel/udev
is doing.

The package header section is common to all packages

The general rules for config:

- only applied on first boot.

Rules about packages in the config:

- a package listed in this map is automatically preinstalled from the store
  on image roll out. `ubuntu-core` is always implicitly installed. The
  `gadget` snap is also installed and can not be (re)configured after the
  install.

The `gadget` part of the `snap.yaml` is not a configuration per se and treated
separately.

Rules about `software`:

- `built-in` is a list of packages that cannot be removed.
- `preinstalled` is a list of packages that are installed but can be removed.
