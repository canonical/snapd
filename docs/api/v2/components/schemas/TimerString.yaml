  A custom schedule format for defining recurring events, combining weekdays, times, spans, and frequencies.

  **Syntax Summary:**
  - A timer string is composed of one or more event sets, separated by ',,'.
  - Each event set can define weekdays ('mon', 'tue', 'wed2', 'fri5') and time windows ('10:00', '09:00-11:00').
  - Weekday spans ('mon-fri') define an event for each day in the span.
  - Time spans ('14:00-16:00') define a single event within the span, which can be divided using a count ('/2').
