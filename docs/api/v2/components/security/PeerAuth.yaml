  **Unix Socket Peer Authentication**

  Authentication is not handled via traditional HTTP headers or tokens. Instead, it is managed at the operating system level using Unix domain socket peer credentials (e.g., `SO_PEERCRED` on Linux).

  **How It Works:**

  1.  The API server listens on a local Unix domain socket.
  2.  When a client connects to this socket, the server can ask the operating system kernel for the client process's credentials.
  3.  The kernel securely provides the client's User ID (UID), Group ID (GID), and Process ID (PID).

  Authorization decisions are then based on this trusted, kernel-provided UID. For example, access may be restricted to only the `root` user (UID 0).
