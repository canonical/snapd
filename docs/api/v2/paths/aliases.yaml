              status-code:
                type: integer
                description: |
                  The status-code property contains the HTTP response value.
                enum:
                  - 200
              status:
                type: string
                description: |
                  The status property contains the textual representation of the 'status-code' property.
                  For the 'status-code' equal to 200, the 'status' is always 'OK'
                enum:
                  - OK
              type:
                type: string
                description: |
                  The type property indicates that this is a synchronous API response and the whole content
                  is now available. The result of the API call is in the result object. The value is always
                  'sync'.
                enum:
                  - sync
              result:
                type: object
                description: |
                  The result object contains information about all the aliases in the system.

                  description: |
                    Each top-level property is a snap instance name. Typically snap instance is
                    the name of the snap, except when parallel-instances as used and the snap name
                    is followed by an underscore and then the instance key.
                  additionalProperties:
                      type: object
                      description: |
                        Each top-level property under the snap name above, is the name of the actual alias.
                        The alias is visible as a top-level command and is exposed on PATH in the system.
                      required:
                        - command
                        - status
                      properties:
                        command:

                          description: |
                            The name of the snap entry-point executable invoked by this alias.
                            This is typically the name of the snap followed by dot and then the name
                            of the application within the snap. It may also be just the name of the snap.
                        status:

                          description: |
                            Status describes the status of the alias. The value 'manual' indicates that the
                            status was created manually by the user. The status 'disabled' indicates the user
                            manually removed the alias (it will not be re-created automatically by snapd).
                            The status 'auto' indicates that the alias was created automatically by snapd.
                          enum:
                            - auto
                            - manual
