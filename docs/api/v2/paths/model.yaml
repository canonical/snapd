  summary: Replace the model assertion
  description: |-
    Replaces the current model assertion, potentially triggering a remodel of
    the system.

    The endpoint accepts two different content types depending on the use case:
    - `application/json`: For a standard (online) remodel where the system will
    fetch required snaps from the store.
    - `multipart/form-data`: For an offline remodel, where the new model
    assertion and all required snaps and other files are provided directly in
    the request.
