  summary: Run snapctl command
  description: |-
    Executes a 'snapctl' command within a given context. This route uses the
    socket /run/snapd-snap.socket. This is intended to be used only from within
    a snap itself.

                The context ID for this call. The context ID is passed to hooks
                through the $SNAP_COOKIE environment variable. The 'snapctl'
                command passes this automatically. For hooks that are calling
                the endpoint manually, the responsibility falls on the binary to
                retrieve the context ID itself.
              example: ABCDEF
            args:
              type: array
              description: A list of arguments to pass to snapctl.
              items:
                type: string
              example: [get, username]
            stdin:
              type: string
              description: |-
                If args is fde-setup-result, provides stdin to the context.
