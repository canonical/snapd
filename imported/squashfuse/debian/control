Description: FUSE filesystem to mount squashfs archives
 This lets you mount SquashFS archives in user-space. It supports almost
 all features of the SquashFS format, yet is still fast and memory-efficient.
 .
 SquashFS is an efficiently compressed, read-only storage format.
 Support for it  has been built into the Linux kernel since 2009. It is
 very common on Live CDs  and embedded Linux distributions.
