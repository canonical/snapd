* Mandatory device cgroup for all snaps using bare and core24 base as well as future bases
* Added API route for creating recovery systems: POST to `/v2/systems` with action `create`
* Added API route for removing recovery systems: POST to `/v2/systems/{label}` with action `remove`
* Support for user daemons by introducing new control switches --user/--system/--users for service start/stop/restart

# New in snapd 2.60.4:
* Switch to plug/slot in the "qualcomm-ipc-router" interface
  but keeping backward compatibility
* Fix "custom-device" udev KERNEL values
* Allow firmware-updater snap to install user-daemons

# NEW in snapd 2.60.3:
* Fix bug in the "private" plug attribute of the shared-memory
  interface that can result in a crash when upgrading from an
  old version of snapd.
* Fix missing integration of the /etc/apparmor.d/tunables/home.d/
  apparmor to support non-standard home directories

# New in snapd 2.60.2:
* Performance improvements for apparmor_parser to compensate for
  the slower `-O expr-simplify` default used. This should bring
  the performance back to the 2.60 level and even increase it
  for many use-cases.
* Bugfixes

# New in snapd 2.60.1:
* Bugfixes
* Use "aes-cbc-essiv:sha256" in cryptsetup on arm 32bit devices
  to increase speed on devices with CAAM support
* Stop using `-O no-expr-simplify` in apparmor_parser to avoid
  potential exponential memory use. This can lead to slower
  policy complication in some cases but it is much safer on
  low memory devices.

# New in snapd 2.60:
* Support for dynamic snapshot data exclusions
* Apparmor userspace is vendored inside the snapd snap
* Added a default-configure hook that exposes gadget default configuration
  options to snaps during first install before services are started

  assertions
* Support validation-sets in the model assertion
* Support new "min-size" field in gadget.yaml
* New interface: "userns"

# New in snapd 2.59.5:
