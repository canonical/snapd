# This program allows one to, relatively easily, iterate on Debian packaging in
# a way that is extremely close to that occurring in the real Debian archive.
#
# The key aspect is that packaging is done on a machine running Debian (either
# 9 or 10), with the real Debian kernel, with real build-packages (that is,
# devoid of any patches potentially present only in Ubuntu), with correct
# pristine build environment, unspoiled by convenience packages often present on
# workstation environments.
#
# The system is "portable", being able to execute on anything capable of
# running Multipass and apt-cacher-ng. The workflow is as follows:
#
# - prepare host environment:
#   $ snap install multipass --classic --edge
#   $ apt install apt-cacher-ng
#		On Debian/Ubuntu:
#		- apt install apt-cacher-ng
#		On openSUSE:
#		- zypper install apt-cacher-ng
#		- echo "Remap-debrep: deb.debian.org/debian ; http://deb.debian.org/debian" >> /etc/apt-cacher-ng/acng.conf
#		- systemctl enable --now apt-cacher-ng.service
#
# - prepare scratch build machine:
#   $ ./debian-package-builder create-debian-10
#   $ ./debian-package-builder prepare-debian-10
# - prepare the source package:
#   On appropriate branch of the git tree compatible with
#   building the debian package, e.g. https://salsa.debian.org/zyga-guest/snapd
#   on the "debian" branch, issue the command
#   $ apt-get build-dep ./
#   $ dpkg-buildpackage -S
#   TIP: you can iterate on the packing and repeat this step!
#   If you need to make patches to upstream snapd parts use the "debian-patches"
#   branch from the same repository, where history is broken down. Then use
#   $ git format-patches 2.37..HEAD (where 2.37 is the release you are working on)
#   ...to export any changes made and place the generated patches as files in the
#   "debian" branch, inside the directory ./debian/patches. Make sure each
#   patch is listed in the file ./debian/patches/series. Then re-run
#   $ dpkg-buildpackage -S
#   The resulting package will be placed in the parent directory of the root of
#   the project, e.g. in $HOME/packaging/src/github.com/snapcore, assuming a
#   setup where the GOPATH was set to $HOME/packaging
# - build the binary package
#   While being in the directory $HOME/packaging/src/github.com/snapcore issue
#   ./debian-packaging-builder build-on-debian-10
#   This step will copy the source package to an appropriate multipass virtual
#   machine and build it there using sbuild. Any build dependencies obtained in
#   this step are automatically cached and are quick to reuse on subsequent
#   runs.
#
#   In case the build fails an interactive shell will be spawned by sbuild, still
#   running inside the virtual machine. The package is unpacked twice, you
#   really only care about the files in the _build directory. You can set
#   GOPATH manually to
#   GOPATH=/path/to/directory/called/_build:/usr/share/gocode and run tests and
#   iterate as usual. The source tree alongside the _build directory is useful
#   for comparison and for generating patches..

# Multipass uses a bridge to communicate with virtual machines it manages.
# The query below picks that bridge and prints the associated IP address.
vm_bridge_ip=$(shell ip --json addr show dev mpqemubr0 | jq --raw-output '.[]|select(.addr_info | length > 0).addr_info[] | select(.scope=="global").local')

# There must be an apt-cacher-ng installation on the host.
proxy_url=http://$(vm_bridge_ip):3142
