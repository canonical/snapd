 enabling secure distribution of the latest apps and utilities for
 cloud, servers, desktops and the internet of things.

# Note that this snap is unusual in that it has no "apps" section.
#
# It is started via re-exec on classic systems and via special
# handling in the core18 snap on Ubuntu Core Systems.
#
# Because snapd itself manages snaps it must currently run totally
# unconfined (even devmode is not enough).
