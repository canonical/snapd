# Welcome to snapd

This is the code repository for **snapd**, the background service that manages
and maintains installed snaps. 

Snaps are app packages for desktop, cloud and IoT that update automatically,
are easy to install, secure, cross-platform and dependency-free. They're being
used on millions of Linux systems every day.

Alongside its various service and management functions, snapd:
- provides the _snap_ command that's used to install and remove snaps and
  interact with the wider snap ecosystem
- implements the confinement policies that isolate snaps from the base system
  and from each other
- governs the interfaces that allow snaps to access specific system resources
  outside of their confinement

For general details, including
[installation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd) and [Getting
started](https://snapcraft.io/docs/getting-started) guides, head over to our
[Snap documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs). If you're looking for
something to install, such as [Spotify](https://snapcraft.io/spotify) or
[Visual Studio Code](https://snapcraft.io/code), take a look at the [Snap
Store](https://snapcraft.io/store). And if you want to build your own snaps,
start with our [Creating a snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/creating-a-snap)
documentation.
