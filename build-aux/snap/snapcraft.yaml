summary: Daemon and tooling that enable snap packages
description: |
  Install, configure, refresh and remove snap packages. Snaps are
  'universal' packages that work across many different Linux systems,
  enabling secure distribution of the latest apps and utilities for
  cloud, servers, desktops and the internet of things.

  Start with 'snap list' to see installed snaps.
adopt-info: snapd-deb
# build-base is needed here for snapcraft to build this snap as with "modern"
# snapcraft
build-base: core18
grade: stable
license: GPL-3.0

# Note that this snap is unusual in that it has no "apps" section.
#
# It is started via re-exec on classic systems and via special
# handling in the core18 snap on Ubuntu Core Systems.
#
# Because snapd itself manages snaps it must currently run totally
# unconfined (even devmode is not enough).
