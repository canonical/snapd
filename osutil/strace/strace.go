package strace

// The package provides helpers for invoking strace to trace the snap execution.
// Since bootstrapping a snap environment involves running a privileged binary,
// the tracing is composed of 2 parts:
//
// - tracee, whose 'lifetime' begins as the first stage of the bootstrap, right
// - after transitioning from `snap run`. This will eventually transition into
// - the desired snap application.
// - tracing application, strace, which attaches to the tracee's execution chain
//
// Running strace as a standalone process which only attaches to the traced
// application has a significant advantage, bootstrapping and the application
// runs in a pristine environment and continues execution in the security
// context of a regular user, in the assigned snap cgroup.
//
// The usual entry point doing all the orchestration is `snap run`. The
// execution injects an additional synchronization step to properly identify a
// moment when the tracee execution check is ready to attach strace and next
// when strace successfully attached to the traced process. The synchronization
// is provided by snap-strace-shim, which has the purpose of raising SIGSTOP,
// which provides the first synchronization point, after which snap run launches
// strace and processes its stderr to identify a moment when strace attached
// to the process held in SIGSTOP handler. At this point sending SIGCONT will
// unblock further execution.
