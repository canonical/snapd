summary: construct a private mount, then mount a new filesystem under it
details: |
    A file system is mounted under a file system that has private mount event
    propagation configured. Here the test focuses on the behavior of a/1 mount.

    What kind of event propagation applies to the new mount point?
    Which, if any, peer groups is the new mount a member of?
prepare: |
    mkdir a
    mount -t tmpfs tmpfs-a a
    mount --make-private a
    mkdir a/1
    mount -t tmpfs tmpfs-a-1 a/1
restore: |
    umount -l a
    rmdir a
debug: |
    tail -n 2 /proc/self/mountinfo

    tail -n 2 /proc/self/mountinfo | ../rewrite-peer-groups.awk | ../mount-point-and-optional-fields.awk >actual.txt
