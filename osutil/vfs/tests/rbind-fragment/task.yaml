summary: show how a fraction of a mount point affects propagation
details: |
  Mounts propagate within their peer group. When mount has sharing enabled,
  bind mount not only replicates the mount in another location, but also
  establishes a peer group shared by both points. Interesting situation arises
  when a fragment of a mount "a/1" is replicated to "b-1". How is propagation
  affected when a new mount is added in "a/2" which is not visible in "b-1"?
prepare: |
  mkdir a
  mount -t tmpfs tmpfs-a a
  mount --make-shared a
  mkdir a/1
  mkdir a/2
  mkdir b-1
  mount --rbind a/1 b-1
  # We rely on propagation for mounts from "a/1" to propagate to "b-1"
  mount -t tmpfs tmpfs-a-1 a/1
  mount -t tmpfs tmpfs-a-2 a/2
restore: |
  umount -l a
  rmdir a
  umount -l b-1
  rmdir b-1
debug: |
  cat mountinfo
execute: |
  cat /proc/self/mountinfo >mountinfo
  # Field 5 is the mount point path.
  tail -n 5 mountinfo | cut -d ' ' -f 5 | cut -c "$(pwd | wc -c)"- >actual.txt
  diff -u actual.txt expected.txt
