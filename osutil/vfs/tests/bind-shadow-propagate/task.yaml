summary: observe how propagation and shadowing interact
details: |
  A slave mount receives mount events from the master. What happens
  when a part of the slave tree is shadowed by another mount, possibly
  one that makes the destination directory inaccessible?
prepare: |
  mkdir a
  mount -t tmpfs tmpfs-a a
  mount --make-shared a
  mkdir a/1
  mount -t tmpfs tmpfs-a-1 a/1
  mkdir a/1/1
  # We stopped short of mounting at a/1/1.
  mkdir b
  mount --rbind a b
  mount --make-rslave b
  # Now "b" has the same content as "a", but with slave propagation.
  # It receives events from "a" but does produce events itself.
  mount -t tmpfs tmpfs-b-1 b/1
  # Now b/1 is no longer the same file system as a/1.
  # What happens to the mount event that propagates from "a/1/1"?
  mount -t tmpfs tmpfs-a-1-1 a/1/1
  # To be sure, the directory b/1/1 does NOT exist.
  test ! -e b/1/1
restore: |
  umount -l a
  rmdir a
  umount -l b
  rmdir b
debug: |
  cat /proc/self/mountinfo
execute: |
  # Print the fifth (mount point) and second-to-last field (file system source).
  tail -n 7 /proc/self/mountinfo | awk '{ print substr($5, length(ENVIRON["PWD"]) + 1) " " $(NF-1) }' >actual.txt
  diff -u actual.txt expected.txt
