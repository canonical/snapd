summary: construct a slave mount, then mount a new filesystem under it
details: |
    A file system is mounted under a file system that has slave mount event
    propagation configured.

    Additional work is necessary to maintain such propagation, as slave exists
    for as long as a shared master still exists elsewhere. Here the test
    focuses on the behavior of b/1 mount.

    What kind of event propagation applies to the new mount point?
    Which, if any, peer groups is the new mount a member of?
