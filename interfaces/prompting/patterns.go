// PathPatternMatch returns true if the given pattern matches the given path.

// Paths to directories are received with trailing slashes, but we don't want
// to require the user to include a trailing '/' if they want to match
// directories (and end their pattern with `{,/}` if they want to match both
// directories and non-directories). Thus, we want to ensure that patterns
// without trailing slashes match paths with trailing slashes. However,
// patterns with trailing slashes should not match paths without trailing
// slashes.
//
// The doublestar package has special cases for patterns ending in `/**` and
// `/**/`: `/foo/**`, and `/foo/**/` both match `/foo` and `/foo/`. We want to
// override this behavior to make `/foo/**/` not match `/foo`. We also want to
// override doublestar to make `/foo` match `/foo/`.
