# Description: This interface allows communication with Dell Systems Management Base Driver
# which provides a sysfs interface for systems management software such as Dell OpenManage
# to perform system management interrupts and host control actions (system power cycle or
# power off after OS shutdown) on certain Dell systems.  The Dell libsmbios project aims
# towards providing access to as much BIOS information as possible.
#
# See http://linux.dell.com/libsmbios/main/ for more information about the libsmbios project.
