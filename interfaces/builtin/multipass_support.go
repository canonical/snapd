/*
 * Multipass is a tool to create and manage Virtual Machines and their images.
 * Each VM runs as a separate "qemu" process (on Linux). VM images are automatically
 * downloaded, but need conversion using "qemu-img". Networking is provided by
 *Â configuring a TUN/TAP network on the host, with DHCP provided by a shared
 * "dnsmasq" process. File sharing between the VM and the host is provided by a
 * "sshfs_server" utility. All these utilities are shipped in the snap.
 *
 * Each of these utilities have a different purpose, and an attempt
 * to confine them all in a single profile would result in an extremely broad AppArmor
 * profile.
 *
 * Instead we defer to Multipass the responsibility of generating custom AppArmor
 * profiles for each of these utilities, and trust it launches each utility with
 * all possible security mechanisms enabled. The Multipass daemon itself will run
 * under this restricted policy.
