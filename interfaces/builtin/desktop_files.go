// The desktop-legacy and unity7 interfaces denies access to the contents of the .desktop files
// located at /var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications; only the list of files is readable.
// The desktop-files interface, instead, gives access to those files contents. But since, in
// AppArmor, a deny access is "stronger", if the desktop-legacy or the unity7 interfaces are
// connected, the access to those contents will be forbidden, no matter what the desktop-files
// interface adds to the AppArmor configuration.
//
// To fix this, a prioritized block is defined with `prioritizedSnippetDesktopFileAccess`, where
// the AppArmor code inserted by desktop-legacy and unity7 to forbid access to those files is
// given a lower priority than the code inserted by desktop-files to allow it. This way, if
// only the desktop-legacy or the unity7 interfaces are connected, everything will work as
// before (no access to the contents of the .desktop files), but if the desktop-info interface
// is connected too, then access to those .desktop files is granted, because the code from
// desktop-legacy and unity7 is removed.
//
// desktop-files is also placed lower than desktop-launch, as that's a more privileged interface.
