// ConfinementOptions describe confinement configuration.
//
// The confinement system controls the initial layout of the mount namespace as
// well as the set of actions a process is allowed to perform. Confinement is
// initially defined by the ConfinementType declared by the snap. It can be
// either "strict", "devmode" or "classic".
//
// The "strict" type uses mount layout that puts the core snap as the root
// filesystem and provides strong isolation from the system and from other
// snaps. Violations cause permission errors or mandatory process termination.
//
// The "devmode" type uses the same mount layout as "strict" but switches
// confinement to non-enforcing mode whenever possible. Violations that would
// result in permission error or process termination are instead permitted. A
// diagnostic message is logged when this occurs.
//
// The "classic" type uses mount layout that is identical to the runtime of the
// classic system snapd runs in, in other words there is no "chroot". Most of
// the confinement is lifted, specifically there's no seccomp filter being
// applied and apparmor is using complain mode by default.
//
// The three types defined above map to some combinations of the three flags
// defined below.
//
// The DevMode flag attempts to switch all confinement facilities into
// non-enforcing mode even if the snap requested otherwise.
//
// The JailMode flag attempts to switch all confinement facilities into
// enforcing mode even if the snap requested otherwise.
//
// The Classic flag switches the layout of the mount namespace so that there's
// no "chroot" to the core snap.
