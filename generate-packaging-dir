# FIXME:
# once we support something other than ubuntu this needs to become
# smarter:
# - debian-sid does not have VERSION_ID, probably best to grep
#   /etc/apt/sources.list there
# - rpm systems do not need the debian dir :)

# update symlink
rm -f debian
ln -s packaging/${ID}-${VERSION_ID} debian
