# This file is used to define which features, groups and tags are available in spread tests
# All these definitions are cross-checked to ensure tests integrity.
# These definitions can be used to define a subset of tests to run but also as a way
# of coverage documentation.

definitions:
    # Features refer to product caracteristics being tested
    # The main porpoise is to know the features testing coverage
    features: [
        interfaces,           # snap interfaces
        snap_refresh,         # snap refresh and snap auto refreshes
        snap_install          # snap install command
        ]

    # Groups are set of tests orthogonal to the suites definition
    # The main porpoise is to run an independent subset of tests to avoid test duplication 
    groups: [
        core_validation,      # Set of tests used to validate ubuntu core images
        sanity                # Minimal set of tests used to validate a system with more coverage than the smoke tests
        ]

    # Tags are free labels used to identify group of tests
    # Those can be used to identify tests that are exercising specific OS features, or are interacting with
    # an external dependency among others. 
    tags: [
        networking,           # OS networking, network managers 
        os_errors             # system errors, segmentation faults, panics, etc 
        ]
