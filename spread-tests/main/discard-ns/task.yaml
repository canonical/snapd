# This is blacklisted on debian because debian doesn't use apparmor yet
systems: [-debian-8]
details: |
    The internal snap-discard-ns program is supposed to simply unmount
    whatever is mounted at /run/snapd/ns/$SNAP_NAME.mnt
prepare: |
    mkdir -p /run/snapd/ns/
    mount --bind /run/snapd/ns /run/snapd/ns
    mount --make-private /run/snapd/ns
    touch /run/snapd/ns/foo.mnt
    unshare --mount=/run/snapd/ns/foo.mnt true
execute: |
    /usr/lib/snapd/snap-discard-ns foo
    ! grep foo.mnt /proc/self/mountinfo
restore: |
    umount /run/snapd/ns/foo.mnt || :
    umount /run/snapd/ns
    rm /run/snapd/ns/foo.mnt
    rm /run/snapd/ns/foo.lock
    # The removal is optional as the directory may contain other files
    # that we don't want to touch here.
    rmdir /run/snapd/ns || true
