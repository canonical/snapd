Subject: [PATCH 3/9] cmd/snap-seccomp: skip tests that use -m32

Apparently Debian's amd64 compiler somehow cannot compile -m32 mode
binaries. The compilation error is:

	multipass@debian-10:~/packaging/snapd/cmd/snap-seccomp$ go test
	cannot build multi-lib syscall runner: exit status 1
	In file included from /usr/include/errno.h:25,
			 from /tmp/check-3806730340354206876/1/seccomp_syscall_runner.c:3:
	/usr/include/features.h:424:12: fatal error: sys/cdefs.h: No such file or directory
	 #  include <sys/cdefs.h>
		    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
	compilation terminated.
	OK: 2 passed, 11 skipped

I was unable to resolve this issue, let's disable this test until we can get to
the bottom of it.
