snapd (2.0.5+1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial Debian upload.  Closes: #824943.
  * release/release{,_test}.go: use /etc/os-release, which is guaranteed to
    be part of base-files on both Ubuntu and Debian, instead of
    /etc/lsb-release which doesn't exist at all on Debian.
  * drop transitional packages, not needed in Debian.
  * Add lintian overrides for false-positive detection of embedded libyaml.
  * Update Vcs-* fields to point at maintainer's branch.
  * Add a further lintian override for the /snap directory so that the
    package is not automatically rejected by the NEW queue; this directory
    location is certainly subject to discussion for Debian, but let's have
    the discussion rather than blocking the package at the archive level.
